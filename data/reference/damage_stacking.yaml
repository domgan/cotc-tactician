# COTC Damage Stacking Reference
# This file documents the 5 multiplicative damage categories.

schema_version: "1.0"

# =============================================================================
# OVERVIEW
# =============================================================================
# COTC damage is calculated using multiple categories that stack
# MULTIPLICATIVELY, not additively.
#
# This means: 30% + 30% + 30% ≠ 90%
# It's actually: 1.3 × 1.3 × 1.3 = 2.197 (119.7% increase)
#
# Understanding this is CRITICAL for EX3 fights with 50-80 million HP.

# MULTIPLICATIVE STACKING EXAMPLE

stacking_example:
  scenario: "Optimal damage setup for EX3"
  
  buffs_applied:
    - category: active_skills
      buff: "30% P.ATK up (Lynette)"
      multiplier: 1.30
    - category: active_skills
      debuff: "30% P.DEF down (Viola + Sarisa)"
      multiplier: 1.30
    - category: passive
      buff: "15% sword damage (Richard passive)"
      multiplier: 1.15
    - category: passive
      debuff: "15% sword RES down (Yan Long A4)"
      multiplier: 1.15
    - category: ultimate
      buff: "100% potency (Solon)"
      multiplier: 2.00
    - category: ultimate
      buff: "20% damage (Primrose EX)"
      multiplier: 1.20
    - category: pet
      buff: "20% damage on break (Linde)"
      multiplier: 1.20
    - category: divine_beast
      buff: "10% damage (Simurgh)"
      multiplier: 1.10
      
  calculation: |
    1.30 × 1.30 × 1.15 × 1.15 × 2.00 × 1.20 × 1.20 × 1.10
    = 6.67x damage multiplier (567% increase)
    
  note: |
    This is why meta teams can hit 500k+ on a single attack.
    Without Solon (2.0x), it would be 3.33x instead.
    Solon literally DOUBLES your damage.
