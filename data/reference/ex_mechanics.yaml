# =============================================================================
# OVERVIEW
# =============================================================================
# EX Fights (Adversary Log / 宿敵の写記) are enhanced rematches of bosses.
# They are NOT just "bosses with more HP" - they have mechanical changes.
#
# Key differences from base fights:
# 1. Significantly higher HP (2x-5x)
# 2. Higher speed stats (speed tuning required)
# 3. More actions per turn (2-3)
# 4. Often provoke immune
# 5. Aura/stance mechanics with counters
# 6. More dangerous HP threshold triggers
#
# Rewards: Rubies, unique accessories, arcana stones

    hp_multiplier: 3.0
    speed_modifier: "+100-150"

    difficulty_tier: "Requires strong team, careful planning"
    notes: |
      Second EX rematch. Some mechanics enhanced.
      HP roughly tripled. High speed requires tuning.
      Most dangerous attacks hit harder.
      
  ex3:
    display_name: "EX3 (Adversary Log Rank 3)"
    hp_multiplier: 5.0
    speed_modifier: "+150-250"
    actions_per_turn: 3

    difficulty_tier: "Endgame content, meta units often required"
    notes: |
      Final EX rematch. Maximum difficulty.
      HP can reach 80+ million for some bosses.
      Triple actions from early in fight.
      Requires either speedkill or full turtle strategy.
      Many fights take 30-100+ turns without optimal setup.

# SURVIVAL REQUIREMENTS
# =============================================================================

survival_requirements:
  minimum_hp:
    ex1: 3000
    ex2: 3500
    ex3: 4000
    notes: |
      HP requirements per character. Achievable via:
      - Pet HP bonuses (+500 typical)
      - HP accessories (Keeper series)
      - Awakening Stage III (+50% HP)
      - Support Passives
      
  recommended_defenses:
    description: "Stack both buffs AND debuffs for safety"
    party_def_buff: "30% P.DEF/E.DEF up (Tatloch, Ophilia, Rinyuu)"
    enemy_atk_debuff: "30% P.ATK/E.ATK down (Therion, Canary, Viola)"
    notes: |
      30% DEF buff = take 30% less damage (direct mitigation)
      30% ATK debuff = enemy deals 30% less damage
      These stack multiplicatively for ~50% damage reduction.

# =============================================================================
# TANK ARCHETYPES FOR EX FIGHTS
# =============================================================================

tank_archetypes:
  - type: provoke_tank
    description: "Draw single-target attacks via Provoke"
    effective_against: "Bosses with single-target heavy attacks"
    limitation: "Many arena/EX bosses are PROVOKE IMMUNE"
    key_characters: ["gilderoy", "serenoa"]
    accessories: ["Serenoa A4 (auto-provoke)", "Bewitching Cloak (provoke + evade)"]
    
  - type: dodge_tank
    description: "Evade attacks entirely via sidestep/dodge buffs"
    effective_against: "Single-target and random-target attacks"
    limitation: "AoE attacks cannot be dodged"
    key_characters: ["h-aanit-ex", "canary", "hammy", "tressa"]
    accessories: ["Edea A4 (auto-provoke at full HP)", "Eleonora A4"]
    notes: |
      Most powerful tank type for EX fights.
      Canary + Edea A4 = auto-provoke + infinite dodge
      H'aanit EX + Hammy = reliable dodge tank
      
  - type: cover_tank
    description: "Intercept attacks meant for allies (Cover ability)"
    effective_against: "All attack types (single, random, even some AoE)"
    limitation: "Only Fiore EX has Cover mechanic"
    key_characters: ["fiore-ex"]
    notes: |
      Fiore EX is the ONLY cover tank in the game.
      Her "Physical Return Melody" reflects damage.
      Essential for some EX3 fights (Gertrude, Yan Long).
      Works even against provoke-immune bosses!
      
  - type: hp_barrier
    description: "Absorb damage with HP shields"
    effective_against: "Burst AoE attacks"
    limitation: "Must refresh barriers before they break"
    key_characters: ["temenos", "millard-ex", "sazantos"]
    notes: |
      Sazantos: AoE magic dodge barrier
      Temenos: HP barriers from skill
      Useful for surviving charge-up attacks.

# =============================================================================
# AURA/STANCE MECHANICS
# =============================================================================

aura_mechanics:
  description: |
    Auras are visible effects (flames/glows) indicating special boss states.
    Common in EX fights and some arena base versions.
    
  types:
    - name: "Weakness Lock Aura"
      indicator: "Purple/blue flame"
      effect: "Certain weaknesses become locked"
      counter: "Hitting locked weakness triggers counter attack"
      removal: "Usually removed by Break"
      example: "Yan Long locks 2 of 3 weaknesses, rotates each turn"
      
    - name: "Counter Stance"
      indicator: "Stance animation/aura"
      effect: "Physical or elemental counter active"
      counter: "Hitting wrong damage type triggers retaliation"
      removal: "Usually removed by Break"
      example: "Tikilen's Physical Counter Stance"
      
    - name: "Multi-Hit Shield Lock"
      indicator: "Visible shield glow"
      effect: "Can only lose 2 shields max per character action"
      counter: "Multi-hit attacks become useless for shield shave"
      removal: "Permanent until break"
      example: "Gertrude's Strong Guard"

# =============================================================================
# SPEED TUNING FOR EX
# =============================================================================

speed_tuning:
  description: |
    EX bosses have much higher speed than base versions.
    Your characters must outspeed them for debuffs to apply before attacks.
    
  priority_order:
    - "Debuffer (must act BEFORE boss hits)"
    - "Buffer (must act BEFORE DPS)"
    - "Tank (if using provoke, must act first for provoke)"
    - "Healer"
    - "DPS (usually slowest, acts after buffs/debuffs)"
    
  speed_accessories:
    - name: "Chomper Outfit"
      effect: "+speed"
      tradeoff: "Lower defenses"
    - name: "Ballen Vest"
      effect: "+speed for 3 turns at battle start"
    - name: "Character A4s"
      effect: "Various speed bonuses"
      
  typical_boss_speeds:
    base: "250-400"
    ex1: "350-500"
    ex2: "400-550"
    ex3: "450-650"

# =============================================================================
# DAMAGE STACKING FOR EX
# =============================================================================

damage_stacking_summary:
  description: |
    To kill EX3 bosses with 50-80 million HP, you MUST stack multiple
    damage categories multiplicatively. See damage_stacking.yaml for details.
    
  categories:
    - category: "Active Skills"
      cap: "30%"
      example: "Lynette's ATK buff, Viola's DEF debuff"
      
    - category: "Passives/Equipment"
      cap: "30%"
      example: "Richard's sword damage passive, A4 accessories"
      
    - category: "Ultimate"
      cap: "Varies (100%+ for Solon)"
      example: "Solon's 100% potency up, Primrose EX ultimate"
      
    - category: "Pets"
      cap: "Varies"
      example: "Linde/Hägen damage up"
      
    - category: "Divine Beast"
      cap: "Varies"
      example: "Simurgh, Fallen Mahrez"
      
  note: |
    All categories stack MULTIPLICATIVELY.
    30% from active + 30% from passive + 100% from Solon ≠ 160%
    It's: 1.3 × 1.3 × 2.0 = 3.38x damage (238% increase)

# =============================================================================
# COMMON EX STRATEGIES
# =============================================================================

common_strategies:
  speedkill:
    description: "Kill before dangerous mechanics activate"
    approach: |
      Stack all damage categories, break on turn 6-7,
      use Solon + Primrose EX to double ultimate damage,
      kill in 1-2 breaks.
    pros: "Fast, avoids dangerous HP thresholds"
    cons: "Requires specific meta units, high investment"
    key_units: ["solon", "primrose-ex", "canary", "nephti"]
    
  turtle:
    description: "Survive everything, chip away slowly"
    approach: |
      Max defense buffs + attack debuffs (30% each),
      dodge tank for single-target attacks,
      HP barriers for AoE nukes,
      slowly break and damage over 50-100+ turns.
    pros: "Works with less invested units"
    cons: "Very slow (30-100+ turns), boring"
    key_units: ["rinyuu", "tatloch", "h-aanit-ex", "fiore-ex"]
    
  two_break:
    description: "Kill in exactly 2 breaks"
    approach: |
      Break on turn 6-7 for first damage window,
      survive post-break attacks,
      break again and finish.
    pros: "Balanced approach for most players"
    cons: "Must survive dangerous post-break phase"
    key_units: ["canary", "rinyuu", "primrose-ex", "viola"]
