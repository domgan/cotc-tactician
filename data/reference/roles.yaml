roles:
  - id: tank
    display_name: Tank
    description: "Absorbs damage for the party via provoke/taunt mechanics"
    key_capabilities:
      - "Provoke/Taunt (redirects single-target and AoE attacks)"
      - "Damage reduction buffs (Def/MDef Up)"
      - "HP Barrier (absorbs damage before HP)"
      - "Counter-attack on being hit"
      - "Physical/Magical Sidestep (dodge mechanics)"
    typical_position: front
    example_skills:
      - "AoE Taunt for 2 turns"
      - "Self 20% Def/MDef Up"
      - "HP Barrier (40% of Max HP)"
      - "Counter Physical Attacks buff"
    notes: |
      Tanks are essential for bosses with strong single-target attacks.
      The Taunt mechanic redirects attacks to the tank.
      HP Barriers absorb damage before HP is reduced.
      Some tanks have "Attention" which forces AoE to target only them.

  - id: healer
    display_name: Healer
    description: "Restores HP to party members"
    key_capabilities:
      - "Single-target healing (Single-Ally Heal)"
      - "Frontrow healing (Frontrow Heal)"
      - "All-party healing (All Allies Heal)"
      - "HP Regen over time (HP Regen for X turns)"
      - "Revive/resurrection (Revive KO'd ally)"
      - "Status ailment removal (Remove certain status ailments)"
    typical_position: any
    example_skills:
      - "Frontrow Heal (205~295 Heal Strength)"
      - "Self/Frontrow HP Regen for 3 turns (110 Regen Strength)"
      - "Revive a KO'd ally with 25-100% of their max HP"
    notes: |
      Healers that can target Frontrow or All Allies are highly valued.
      Regen effects are commonly applied at battle start and maintained.
      Some healers also provide buffs (role compression with Buffer).

  - id: buffer
    display_name: Buffer
    description: "Increases party stats and damage output"
    key_capabilities:
      - "Atk/Mag Up buffs (15-30% common)"
      - "Weapon damage buffs (Sword/Spear/etc. Damage Up)"
      - "Element damage buffs (Fire/Ice/etc. Damage Up)"
      - "Crit Rate Up and Guaranteed Crit"
      - "Damage Cap Up (+50,000 to +100,000)"
      - "Potency Up (multiplies final damage)"
      - "BP Regen (+1 BP/turn)"
      - "SP Regen (recover SP each turn)"
    typical_position: any
    example_skills:
      - "Frontrow 20% Atk/Sword Dmg/Spear Dmg Up for 2-5 turns"
      - "Self Guaranteed Crit for 3 turns"
      - "Self 100% Potency Up for 2 turns"
      - "Frontrow +1 BP Regen for 3 turns"
    notes: |
      Buffers should act BEFORE DPS units in turn order (speed tuning).
      Buff stacking and duration management is critical.
      Active buffs typically cap at 30%, passives at 30% separately.
      Potency Up doesn't stack with similar sources.
      Damage Cap Up is essential for high-damage strategies.

  - id: debuffer
    display_name: Debuffer
    description: "Decreases enemy stats and resistances"
    key_capabilities:
      - "Def/MDef Down (increases damage taken)"
      - "Weapon Res Down (Sword/Spear/etc. Res Down)"
      - "Element Res Down (Fire/Ice/etc. Res Down)"
      - "Physical/Elemental Res Down (generic)"
      - "Atk/Mag Down (reduces enemy damage)"
      - "Speed Down (changes turn order)"
      - "Weakness Implant (adds weakness or amplifies damage)"
      - "Critical Scope (all hits become crits)"
    typical_position: any
    example_skills:
      - "inflict 15% Def Down for 2 turns"
      - "inflict 20% Sword Res Down for 3 turns"
      - "Single-Enemy 20% Light Res Down for 2-5 turns"
      - "Sword Weakness Implant for 4 hits"
      - "Critical Scope for 1-4 turns"
    notes: |
      Debuffs on enemies can be stacked up to a cap (usually 30%).
      Res Down effects multiply damage significantly.
      Some skills both deal damage and apply debuffs (role compression).
      Weakness Implant adds the weakness or increases damage by 20% per stack.
      Critical Scope forces all damage to crit - very powerful.

  - id: breaker
    display_name: Breaker
    description: "Efficiently reduces enemy shield count"
    key_capabilities:
      - "High hit-count skills (4x, 5x, 6x+ hits)"
      - "[Priority] skills (act before normal turn order)"
      - "Always reduces Shield Points (ignores conditions)"
      - "Random-target attacks (hit multiple times)"
      - "+1 Shield damage when hitting weakness"
      - "Multi-weapon attacks (hit Sword AND Spear weakness)"
    typical_position: any
    example_skills:
      - "4x random-target Sword (4x 45~90 Power)"
      - "[Priority] 4x Single Target Sword"
      - "also hits Dark weakness (expands weakness coverage)"
      - "+1 shield damage when hitting Sword weakness"
    notes: |
      Breaking (reducing shields to 0) stuns the enemy and increases
      damage taken. Break lasts for the current turn and next turn.
      Boosted weapon attacks multiply hit count for faster breaking.
      Some skills "also hit X weakness" expanding breaking options.
      [Priority] skills act before normal turn order.

  - id: dps
    display_name: DPS (Damage Dealer)
    description: "Deals high damage, especially during break windows"
    key_capabilities:
      - "High power skills (260~450+ Power)"
      - "Weakness exploitation (power multiplier on weakness)"
      - "Self-buff stacking (Atk Up, Damage Up, etc.)"
      - "Guaranteed Critical / Crit multiplier increase"
      - "Doublecast/Triplecast (reuse skill automatically)"
      - "Damage Cap Up (+100,000 or more)"
      - "Potency Up (100% = double damage)"
      - "Power x2 if condition met (broken, debuffed, etc.)"
    typical_position: any
    example_skills:
      - "1x single-target Sword (1x 260~450 Power)"
      - "Power x1.5 if target is Broken"
      - "Self Guaranteed Crit for 3 turns"
      - "Self cast attacking skills twice in a row for 2-5 turns"
      - "This attack has +100,000 Damage Cap"
    notes: |
      DPS units should receive all buffs before acting (speed tuning).
      Break windows are the primary damage opportunity - damage is amplified.
      Damage Cap limits maximum damage per hit; Damage Cap Up raises this.
      Potency Up multiplies final damage (100% = 2x damage).
      Focus on one or two main DPS rather than spreading damage.

# =============================================================================
# ROLE COMPRESSION
# =============================================================================
# Many characters fill multiple roles simultaneously.
# A character can be tagged with multiple roles (e.g., [buffer, dps]).
# This is valuable for limited party slots (4 front, 4 back).
#
# Examples from community data:
# - Richard: Buffer (Frontrow Sword/Spear Dmg Up) + DPS
# - Eliza: Healer (Frontrow Heal) + DPS (Light damage)
# - Lionel: Tank (Taunt) + DPS (Sword damage)
# - Sazantos: Buffer + Healer + DPS
