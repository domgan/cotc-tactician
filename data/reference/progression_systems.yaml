# =============================================================================
# AWAKENING STAGES (I-IV)
# =============================================================================
# Awakening increases stats and unlocks battle skill SLOTS.
# It does NOT unlock specific skills - skills are tied to character rarity.

awakening_stages:
  stage_1:
    name: "Awakening Stage I"
    effect: "Base attributes (Phys. Atk, Phys. Def, Elem. Atk, Elem. Def, Critical, Speed) +30% (Up to 50%)"
    notes: "First awakening, requires awakening materials"

  stage_2:
    name: "Awakening Stage II"
    effect: "Unlocks the fourth battle skill slot"
    notes: "Allows equipping 4 skills instead of 3"

  stage_3:
    name: "Awakening Stage III"
    effect: "Base attributes (HP) +50% (Up to 1,000)"
    notes: "Significant HP boost"

  stage_4:
    name: "Awakening Stage IV"
    effect: "Obtain special items (A4 accessory, varies by character)"
    notes: "3★ travelers cannot reach Stage 4"
    restriction: "5★ and promoted 4★ characters only"

# =============================================================================
# 6★ / LIMIT BREAK
# =============================================================================
# This is NOT an awakening stage. It's a separate system.

limit_break:
  name: "6★ Limit Break"
  requirements: "Requires specific materials after max awakening"
  effects:
    - "Raises level cap to 120 (from 100)"
    - "Additional stat increases"
    - "May upgrade existing skills or passives"
  notes: |
    Skill upgrades at 6★ are shown in spreadsheet as "6*" column.
    Not all skills/passives get upgrades - character specific.

# =============================================================================
# BLESSING OF THE LANTERN
# =============================================================================
# Unlocks additional skills (TP system)

blessing_of_the_lantern:
  name: "Blessing of the Lantern"
  effects:
    - "Unlocks TP Passive ability"
    - "Unlocks TP Active skill (granted by TP passive)"
  notes: |
    Requires duplicate characters or specific materials.
    TP passive often has a secondary effect that unlocks a new active skill.
    Some characters may only get passive, some get both.

# =============================================================================
# SKILL BOARDS
# =============================================================================
# Characters have skill boards (3-6 boards depending on rarity).
# The star rating (1★-5★) in spreadsheets indicates which board a skill is on.
# This is organizational only - for our purposes, we assume max level.

skill_boards:
  description: |
    Skill star ratings in the spreadsheet indicate which skill board they're on.
    This is purely organizational - NOT an unlock requirement.
    
    For team composition purposes, we assume:
    - 3★ characters: Lv60, all their skills available
    - 4★ characters: Lv80, all their skills available  
    - 5★ characters: Lv100, all their skills available
    - 6★ characters: Lv120, all their skills available (includes Limit Break upgrades)
    
    Characters can be "overclassed" - a base 5★ can become 6★ via Limit Break.
    
    You can only EQUIP 4 skills at once in battle.
    Awakening Stage II unlocks the 4th equip slot.

  battle_skill_slots:
    slot_1: "Available from start"
    slot_2: "Available from start"
    slot_3: "Available from start"
    slot_4: "Unlocked at Awakening Stage II"

# =============================================================================
# EX SKILL
# =============================================================================
ex_skill:
  description: |
    EX skills are conditional abilities that activate when their trigger is met.
    They don't take up a skill slot - they're always "available" when conditions allow.
    
  examples:
    - trigger: "Turn 4 onwards"
    - trigger: "No enemies are broken"
    - trigger: "Self HP = 100%"
    - trigger: "After using Special"

# =============================================================================
# SPECIAL / ULTIMATE
# =============================================================================
special_skill:
  description: |
    Special (Ultimate) skills use a separate gauge that fills during battle.
    They have 3 levels (Lv1, Lv10, Lv20) with increasing power.
    Some can use 200% gauge for enhanced effects.
    
  gauge:
    - "100% gauge: Normal special"
    - "200% gauge: Enhanced special (if character supports it)"
