# TACTICAL USE OF STATUS AILMENTS
# =============================================================================

tactical_notes: |
  BLEED/POISON SYNERGIES:
  - Some characters deal bonus damage to bleeding/poisoned enemies
  - Apply early, let it tick while you set up
  - Minor damage adds up over long fights
  
  BURNING FOR SHIELD SHAVE:
  - Burning is essentially free shield damage each turn
  - Stack with active shield breaking for faster breaks
  - Especially valuable against high-shield bosses
  
  CROWD CONTROL:
  - Most bosses resist or are immune to hard CC
  - CC is more useful for trash mobs
  - Check boss data before relying on CC
  
  DEFENSE DOWN:
  - This is NOT a status ailment, it's a debuff
  - Debuffs are covered in buff_categories.yaml
  - Debuffs are core to damage strategy
