schema_version: "1.0"

# =============================================================================
# DAMAGE MULTIPLIERS
# =============================================================================
# These are the core multipliers that determine damage output.
# Understanding these is critical for maximizing DPS during break windows.

damage_multipliers:
  # Standard PvE content
  pve:
    off_weakness: 1.0
    weakness: 2.5
    break: 2.0
    weakness_and_break: 5.0  # 2.5 * 2.0 = 5x damage!
    
  # Arena (PvP) - off-weakness is heavily penalized
  arena:
    off_weakness: 0.5
    weakness: 2.5
    break: 2.0
    weakness_and_break: 5.0

# =============================================================================
# CRITICAL HITS
# =============================================================================

critical_hits:
  damage_bonus: 1.25  # 25% more damage
  
  rules:
    - "Only PHYSICAL (weapon-type) attacks can crit"
    - "ELEMENTAL attacks CANNOT crit"
    - "Guaranteed Crit buffs force all physical hits to crit"
    - "Crit Rate Up increases chance of critting"
    
  implications:
    - "PDPS benefits from crit, EDPS does not"
    - "Crit damage buffs only matter for physical attackers"
    - "When building EDPS, ignore crit stats entirely"

# =============================================================================
# PHYSICAL DAMAGE FORMULA (from JP data)
# =============================================================================

physical_damage_formula:
  formula: "Base P.Atk * (Base P.Atk + P.Atk from Equipment - Enemy P.Def) * Skill Potency * Grade Correction * buffs&debuffs"
  
  components:
    base_p_atk: "Character's base physical attack stat"
    equipment_p_atk: "Physical attack bonus from weapon and accessories"
    enemy_p_def: "Enemy's physical defense (reduces damage)"
    skill_potency: "The skill's power value (e.g., 260~450)"
    grade_correction: "Weapon grade multiplier"
    buffs_debuffs: "All active buff/debuff multipliers"

# =============================================================================
# ELEMENTAL DAMAGE
# =============================================================================

elemental_damage:
  notes:
    - "Scales with Elem ATK stat"
    - "Cannot crit (no crit bonus)"
    - "Affected by element-specific buffs/debuffs"
    - "Uses EDEF for damage reduction"

# =============================================================================
# DAMAGE TYPES
# =============================================================================

damage_types:
  physical:
    stat: p_atk
    defense: p_def
    can_crit: true
    weapons: [sword, polearm, dagger, axe, bow, staff]
    notes: "Most weapon attacks are physical"
    
  elemental:
    stat: e_atk
    defense: e_def
    can_crit: false
    elements: [fire, ice, lightning, wind, light, dark]
    notes: "Magic/spell attacks are elemental"

# =============================================================================
# DAMAGE CAP
# =============================================================================

damage_cap:
  default: 99999  # Standard max damage per hit
  
  cap_increases:
    - "+50,000 Damage Cap (some skills/passives)"
    - "+100,000 Damage Cap (powerful skills)"
    - "Soul skills can have very high caps"
    
  notes: |
    Damage Cap limits maximum damage per HIT, not per skill.
    Multi-hit skills can exceed total cap by hitting multiple times.
    Damage Cap Up is essential for high-damage strategies.

# =============================================================================
# TACTICAL IMPLICATIONS
# =============================================================================

tactical_notes: |
  MAXIMIZING DAMAGE:
  1. Always hit weakness when possible (2.5x multiplier)
  2. Stack damage during break window (additional 2x)
  3. Weakness + Break = 5x damage - this is THE damage window
  4. For physical DPS, ensure crit (additional 1.25x)
  5. Cap all relevant buffs (30%) before break
  6. Cap all relevant debuffs on enemy (30%) before break
  
  ARENA SPECIFIC:
  - Off-weakness damage is halved (0.5x)
  - MUST hit weakness or damage is severely reduced
  - Team composition for Arena requires careful weakness planning
  
  DPS TYPE SELECTION:
  - PDPS: Benefits from crit, use for physical-weak bosses
  - EDPS: No crit bonus but consistent, use for element-weak bosses
  - Some characters can do both (hybrid)
