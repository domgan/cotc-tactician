# OVERVIEW
# =============================================================================
# Survival in COTC endgame (EX fights, tower, etc.) requires one or more
# of these strategies. The best teams often combine multiple approaches.
#
# Key insight: "The best defense is a good offense" - killing bosses quickly
# before dangerous mechanics is often more effective than tanking.

tank_types:
  provoke:
    display_name: "Provoke Tank"
    description: |
      Draw single-target attacks to a designated tank using Provoke skill.
      Tank absorbs damage while team attacks freely.
      
    how_it_works: |
      1. Tank uses Provoke skill on boss
      2. All single-target attacks hit the tank
      3. Tank survives via high HP/DEF or damage reduction
      4. Party is free to attack/buff/heal

        notes: "Classic provoke tank with HP regen"
      - id: serenoa
        notes: "A4 gives auto-provoke, Decisive Resolve for survival"
      - id: olberic
        notes: "Cross Slash counter, but less survivable"
        
    key_accessories:
      - name: "Serenoa A4 (Crest of House Wolffort)"
        effect: "Auto-provoke at battle start (3 turns)"
      - name: "Bewitching Cloak"
        effect: "Provoke + chance to dodge"
        
    limitations:
      - "Many arena/EX bosses are PROVOKE IMMUNE"
      - "Cannot redirect AoE attacks"
      - "Random-target attacks may bypass provoke"
      
    best_for:
      - "Story bosses"
      - "NPCs that allow provoke"
      - "Fights with heavy single-target damage"

  dodge:
    display_name: "Dodge Tank"
    description: |
      Evade attacks entirely via Sidestep stacks or dodge buffs.
      Most powerful tank type for endgame content.
      
    how_it_works: |
      1. Dodge tank gets Sidestep stacks (physical evasion)
      2. Combine with Provoke or auto-provoke to draw attacks
      3. Each attack consumes one Sidestep stack
      4. Refresh stacks before running out
      
    key_characters:
      - id: h-aanit-ex
        notes: "Best dodge tank. Turn 1 AoE debuff + self-dodge stacks"
      - id: canary
        notes: "Auto-dodge via passive, 7-hit shield shave, debuffs"
      - id: hammy
        notes: "Grants dodge to paired ally, not a tank herself"
      - id: tressa
        notes: "Sidestep stacks, can grant to others"
      - id: molu
        notes: "Self-dodge (Fleeting Feline)"
        
    key_accessories:
      - name: "Edea A4"
        effect: "Auto-provoke when HP is 100%"
      - name: "Eleonora A4"
        effect: "Battle start magic evasion"
        
    key_combos:
      - combo: "Canary + Edea A4"
        effect: "Auto-provoke + infinite dodge at full HP"
        notes: "The gold standard for EX fights"
      - combo: "H'aanit EX + Hammy (back row)"
        effect: "H'aanit gets dodge from Hammy passive"
        notes: "Hammy grants dodge to front paired ally"
        
    limitations:
      - "AoE attacks CANNOT be dodged"
      - "Need to refresh stacks regularly"
      - "Some attacks pierce dodge"
      
    best_for:
      - "EX fights (provoke immune)"
      - "Bosses with heavy single/random-target attacks"
      - "Arena champions"

  cover:
    display_name: "Cover Tank"
    description: |
      Intercept attacks meant for other allies.
      Only Fiore EX has this mechanic.
      
    how_it_works: |
      1. Fiore EX uses Cover ability
      2. Attacks targeting allies hit Fiore EX instead
      3. She can reflect physical damage back
      4. Works even against provoke-immune bosses!
      
    key_characters:
      - id: fiore-ex
        notes: "ONLY cover tank in the game"
        skills:
          - "Physical Return Melody (reflects physical damage)"
          - "Cover stance (absorbs attacks for allies)"
          
    limitations:
      - "Only Fiore EX can do this"
      - "Must choose physical OR magic protection"
      - "Cannot fully protect against mixed damage types"
      
    best_for:
      - "Provoke-immune bosses (Gertrude, Yan Long)"
      - "Fights with predictable single-target patterns"
      - "Cheesing certain mechanics"

  hp_barrier:
    display_name: "HP Barrier"
    description: |
      Create HP shields that absorb damage before HP.
      Good for surviving burst AoE attacks.
      
    how_it_works: |
      1. Cast HP barrier skill on party/front row
      2. Barrier absorbs damage up to its value
      3. Barrier breaks when damage exceeds value
      4. Recast before big attacks
      
    key_characters:
      - id: sazantos
        notes: "AoE magic dodge/barrier for front row"
      - id: temenos
        notes: "HP barriers from skills"
      - id: millard-ex
        notes: "Barrier and healing combined"
        
    limitations:
      - "Barriers break if damage exceeds value"
      - "Must time refresh correctly"
      - "Some attacks pierce barriers"
      
    best_for:
      - "Charge-up AoE attacks (boss telegraphs)"
      - "Supplementing other tank strategies"
      - "Magic-heavy bosses (Sazantos)"

# DEFENSIVE STRATEGIES
# =============================================================================

defensive_strategies:
  turtle:
    display_name: "Turtle (Full Defense)"
    description: |
      Maximize both defense buffs AND attack debuffs.
      Chip away at boss over many turns.
      
    core_principle: |
      30% DEF buff + 30% ATK debuff = ~50% damage reduction
      These stack multiplicatively, not additively.
      
    required_characters:
      defense_buffers:
        - "Tatloch (P.DEF/E.DEF + passive healing)"
        - "Ophilia (all front row defense)"
        - "Rinyuu (Crusader's Prayer for defense)"
      attack_debuffers:
        - "Therion (P.ATK/E.ATK down)"
        - "Canary (15% each stack)"
        - "Viola (Debilitate, Anti-Attack II)"
        
    combo_example: |
      Rinyuu: 30% DEF up + HP regen
      Tatloch: Passive P.DEF/E.DEF for front
      Viola: 30% P.ATK/E.ATK down on boss
      Result: Take ~50% less damage, passive healing
      
    turn_count: "30-100+ turns typical for EX3"
    
    best_for:
      - "Players without speedkill units"

      - "Fights with no enrage timer"

  speedrun:
    display_name: "Speedrun (Kill Before Danger)"
    description: |
      Maximize damage to kill boss before dangerous mechanics.
      Requires high investment and specific units.
      
    core_principle: |

    required_setup:
      buffs:
        - "30% ATK up (Lynette, Primrose EX)"

        - "Solon: Double ultimate damage"
        - "Primrose EX: Extension + damage up"
        
    key_units: ["solon", "primrose-ex", "canary", "nephti", "richard"]

      - "Bosses with dangerous low-HP mechanics"
      - "Time-limited challenges"

  two_break:
    display_name: "Two Break Strategy"
    description: |
      Balanced approach: survive to break twice, burst during breaks.
      Most accessible for mid-game players.
      
    approach: |
      Turn 1-5: Setup (buffs, debuffs, shield shave)
      Turn 6-7: First break, deal damage
      Turn 8-10: Survive post-break attacks
      Turn 11-12: Second break, finish boss
      
    required_elements:
      - "Reliable tank/survival"
      - "Good shield shaving"
