# META ARCHETYPES
# =============================================================================

meta_archetypes:
  speedclear_meta:
    description: "Kill boss as fast as possible, minimal turns"
    philosophy: |
      Stack all buffs/debuffs, break fast, kill in 1-2 break cycles.
      Requires well-built characters with optimal gear.
      High risk if something goes wrong.
    key_elements:
      - "Maximum damage buffs (30% cap)"
      - "Maximum defense debuffs on enemy (30% cap)"
      - "Weakness + Break window optimization"
      - "Multi-hit high-power DPS"
      - "Priority breakers for controlled break timing"
    pros:
      - "Fastest clear times"
      - "Less resource consumption"
      - "Feels powerful"
    cons:
      - "Requires good roster and gear"
      - "Punishing if you fail to kill in break window"
      - "Less forgiving of mistakes"
      
  turtle_meta:
    description: "Slow and steady, survive everything"
    philosophy: |
      Prioritize survival, tank damage, heal through attacks.
      Chip away at boss over many turns.
      Very safe but time-consuming.
    key_elements:
      - "Strong tank with taunt"
      - "Reliable healing and regen"
      - "Defense buffs"
      - "Attack debuffs on enemy"
      - "Patience"
    pros:
      - "Very safe"
      - "Works with weaker roster"
      - "Forgiving of mistakes"
    cons:
      - "Slow clear times"
      - "SP management can be issue"
      - "Some bosses have enrage timers"
      
  balanced_meta:
    description: "Mix of offense and defense"
    philosophy: |
      Maintain enough survival to get to break window,
      then burst during break. Most practical approach.
    key_elements:
      - "Regen for passive healing"
      - "Tank for big attacks"
      - "Buff/debuff for damage"
      - "Focused DPS during break"
    pros:
      - "Flexible"
      - "Adapts to different bosses"
      - "Practical for most content"

# =============================================================================
# TEAM BUILDING PRINCIPLES
# =============================================================================

team_building:
  party_size:
    front_row: 4
    back_row: 4
    total: 8
    notes: "Back row recovers HP/SP each turn, can swap in"
    
  core_roles:
    required:
      - "DPS (at least 1-2, focused on boss weakness)"
      - "Healer/Regen (maintain HP)"
      - "Buffer (cap relevant damage buffs)"
      - "Debuffer (cap relevant defense debuffs)"
    optional:
      - "Tank (for bosses with big attacks)"
      - "Breaker (if DPS can't break efficiently)"
      - "Support (role compression)"
      
  role_compression:
    description: "Characters that fill multiple roles"
    importance: "Extremely valuable with 4 front slots"
    examples:
      - "Richard: Buffer + DPS"
      - "Primrose EX: Buffer + Healer + Regen"
      - "Viola: Debuffer + Breaker"
      
  weakness_focus:
    principle: "Focus on 1-2 boss weaknesses, not all"
    reasoning: |
      Weakness damage is 2.5x.
      Stacking damage buffs for one type is more effective
      than spreading across many types.
    example: |
      Boss weak to Sword, Axe, Fire, Wind, Light
      Team focuses on Sword:
      - Sword DPS
      - Sword damage buffer
      - Sword resistance debuffer
      Result: Massive sword damage during break

# =============================================================================
# BREAK STRATEGY
# =============================================================================

break_strategy:
  preparation:
    - "Apply buffs early (so duration lasts through break)"
    - "Apply debuffs (30% cap before breaking)"
    - "Get enemy to 1 shield"
    - "Position DPS with full boost ready"
    
  execution:
    - "Fast unit or [Priority] skill breaks enemy"
    - "Enemy moves to end of turn order"
    - "All DPS act on broken enemy (5x damage with weakness)"
    - "Next turn, enemy still broken - continue damage"
    
  damage_window:
    - "Weakness (2.5x) + Break (2x) = 5x damage"
    - "Add 30% ATK buffs"
    - "Add 30% DEF debuffs"
    - "Add 25% crit bonus (physical only)"
    - "Result: Massive damage"
