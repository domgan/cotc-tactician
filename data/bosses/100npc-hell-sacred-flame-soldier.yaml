special_mechanics:
  - name: "Counter Rotation"
    description: |
      Boss alternates between Dark Counter and Dagger Counter based on
      break recovery turn:
      - ODD turn recovery: Dark Counter (3 turns) - DO NOT USE DARK
      - EVEN turn recovery: Dagger Counter (3 turns) - DO NOT USE DAGGER
      
      Counter effects:
      - Dark Counter: Physical attack + boss gains 3 BP
      - Dagger Counter: Physical attack + boss heals 50,000 HP
      
      STRATEGY: Time your breaks to control which counter is active!
      
  - name: "Swap Manipulation"
    description: |
      Many attacks force swap or prevent swapping.
      - "Knock Down" and "Thunder Sword Slash" prevent swapping
      - "Blowing Double Fists" forces back row swap
      
      Prepare for disrupted formations!

# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  HARDEST 100 NPC (★★★★★★) - Complex counter mechanics.
  
  KEY MECHANIC: Counter Rotation
  - ODD turn break recovery → Dark Counter (3 turns)
  - EVEN turn break recovery → Dagger Counter (3 turns)
  
  CRITICAL: 
  - Do NOT use Dark attacks when Dark Counter is active
  - Do NOT use Dagger attacks when Dagger Counter is active
  - Counter triggers heal boss 50k HP or give boss 3 BP!
  
  Status Effects:
  - Boss has PERMANENT status immunity from turn 1
  - Boss can inflict Paralysis and Swap Prohibition
  
  Formation Disruption:
  - Several attacks force swaps or prevent swapping
  - Plan for chaotic formations
  
  Recommended approach:
  1. Track break timing (odd vs even turn)
  2. Avoid dark/dagger based on active counter
  3. Use physical-focused team if possible
  4. Bring paralysis resistance if available
