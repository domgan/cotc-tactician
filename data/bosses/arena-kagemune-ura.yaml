# MECHANICS
# ===========================================================================
mechanics:
  - name: "Evasion System"
    mechanic_type: passive
    trigger: "Battle start and ongoing"
    target: all
    damage_type: none
    threat_level: critical
    counter_strategy: |
      DO NOT use random/AoE attacks when Kagemune has evasion stacks!
      Evasion triggers COUNTER attacks that hit hard + apply DoTs.
      Use SINGLE-TARGET attacks only.
      
      Exception: If going for 1-break kill at HP ≥90%, random/AoE work until 90%.

  - name: "Shadow Clone Summoning"
    mechanic_type: other
    trigger: "End of turn when HP <90% and no clones"
    target: all
    damage_type: none
    threat_level: critical
    counter_strategy: |
      Clones share main body's buffs.
      AoE attacks against clones = ALL counter.
      
      CRITICAL: Breaking MAIN BODY instantly removes all clones!
      Identify main body (left-bottom on first clone use).
      Clones use countdown attack - main body doesn't.

  - name: "Break Recovery Lock"
    mechanic_type: debuff_party
    trigger: "Break recovery (HP <90%)"
    target: all
    damage_type: none
    effects: ["switch_lock", "physical_seal_front", "elemental_seal_back", "multi_hit_shield_lock"]
    threat_level: critical
    counter_strategy: |
      After break recovery:
      - Front row can't switch, physical attacks fail
      - Back row elemental attacks fail
      - Multi-hit shield lock active
      
      Plan for 1-2 turns of reduced capability after breaks.

  - name: "追撃/Counterattack on Pursuit"
    mechanic_type: counter
    trigger: "Using characters with pursuit abilities"
    target: all
    damage_type: physical
    threat_level: high
    counter_strategy: |
      Characters with AoE/random pursuits (Midiya, Erika EX, Hugebrave, Osvald) 
      trigger counter even from pursuit!
      DISABLE pursuit support abilities or don't bring these characters.

required_roles:
  - role: breaker
    priority: required
    reason: "Need SINGLE-TARGET breakers (polearm/bow/fire/light)"
  - role: healer
    priority: required
    reason: "Heavy DoT damage (Burning/Corrosion/Poison)"
  - role: debuffer
    priority: strongly_recommended
    reason: "P.ATK debuff reduces counter damage"
  - role: dps
    priority: required
    reason: "SINGLE-TARGET DPS only! No AoE/random pursuers!"
  - role: tank
    priority: strongly_recommended
    reason: "Can absorb single/random attacks with status immunity"

recommended_weakness_coverage:
  - polearm  # Single-target preferred
  - bow      # Single-target preferred
  - fire     # Single-target preferred
  - light    # Single-target preferred

# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  Kagemune (Ura) is a ninja with shadow clones and deadly counters.
  
  ⚠️ CRITICAL RULE: NO RANDOM/AOE ATTACKS!
  Kagemune evades and COUNTERS random/AoE attacks.
  Counters apply Burning/Frostbite/Corrosion.
  This includes PURSUIT ABILITIES from characters like Midiya, Erika EX!
  
  RECOMMENDED: 1-BREAK KILL
  - HP is ~5 million
  - At HP ≥90%, evasion is only for random attacks
  - AoE and single-target work fine
  - Take time to setup buffs/debuffs
  - Break and burst for 1-break kill
  
  If 1-break kill fails, fight becomes very complex:
  - Clones appear
  - All 3 (or 4) can counter
  - Main body left-bottom on first clone
  - Clones use countdown, main body doesn't
  - Breaking main removes ALL clones
  
  BREAK RECOVERY PENALTY:
  - Front: Can't switch + Physical fails
  - Back: Elemental fails
  - Multi-hit shield lock
  
  TANK RECOMMENDATIONS:
  - Use provoke tank with status immunity
  - Absorb single/random attacks
  - Burning/Poison/Corrosion gear essential
  
  RECOMMENDED SINGLE-TARGET DPS:
  - Midiya (disable pursuit!)
  - Pardis III
  - Kaine
  - Ditreina EX (disable pursuit!)
  - Hugebrave (disable pursuit!)
  - Oscar
  - Erika
  - Sazantos / Sazantos EX
  - Straybow
  - Frederica
  - Sowan
  
  BREAK EXTENSION:
  - Nier (2B) is excellent for extending break for 1-break kill

common_mistakes:
  - "Using AoE/random attacks (triggers counter)"
  - "Keeping pursuit abilities enabled"
  - "Not preparing status immunity for tank"
  - "Attacking clones instead of main body"
  - "Not tracking main body position"
