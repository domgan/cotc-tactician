# STRATEGY
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  This is a 120 NPC fight with very high shields (38).
  
  Key considerations:
  1. Focus on ONE weakness type for damage (stack buffs/debuffs)
  2. Use multi-hit breakers to shave 38 shields efficiently
  3. Apply all buffs/debuffs before break
  4. Burst during the 2-turn break window
  5. May take multiple break cycles
