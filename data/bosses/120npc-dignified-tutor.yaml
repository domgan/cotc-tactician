  Dignified Tutor (Noble Tutor) is one of the harder 120 NPCs.
  Shield: 38, Weakness: Sword, Dagger, Light
  
  ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES:
  
  1. MAX 8 DEBUFF ICONS!
     If boss has 9+ icons at turn end:
     - Gains permanent P.DEF/E.DEF/Speed up
     - Purges all debuffs
     - FIGHT IS UNWINNABLE!
     Count every icon every turn!
  
  2. NO PROVOKE!
     If provoked: Gains permanent damage up.
     Use COVER tanks only (Fiore EX, not Gilderoy).
  
  3. TURN 14 ENRAGE
     Must defeat before turn 14 or face 99,999 overkill.
  
  RECOMMENDED APPROACH (BannerGs):
  
  Break timing: Turns 4, 9, 13, 16
  - Prevents BP MAX ultimate
  - After 2nd break: Boss has 3 actions
  
  Use Canary's Ultimate to break, then immediately:
  - Primrose EX Elevating Elixir cleanses P.ATK/E.ATK down
  
  2nd break turn: Solon Ultimate on DPS, then Primrose Ultimate
  - This charges Solon for another ultimate later
  
  Post-break: Use Bargello Ultimate for SP and ultimate charging
  
  LOWEST HP TARGETING:
  - Boss targets lowest HP front row member
  - Set Canary as lowest HP (she can dodge)
  
  TEAM EXAMPLE (BannerGs - 17 turn, 4 break):
  Front: Canary/Falco 6*/Bargello/Primrose EX
  Back: Solon/Alaune EX/Rinyuu/Sonia
  
  TEAM EXAMPLE (Anteo_05 - 10-11 turn, 2 break):
  Front: Sazantos/Throne/Cecil/Canary
  Back: Signa/Primrose/Shana/Alaune EX

common_mistakes:
  - "Applying 9+ debuffs (instant loss)"
  - "Using provoke tanks (permanent damage up)"
  - "Taking too long - turn 14 enrage is fatal"
  - "Not tracking debuff icon count"
  - "Having wrong character as lowest HP"
