  EX3 Ignazio of Greed - WEAKNESS-ONLY fight with regen.
  
  EX3 CHARACTERISTICS:
  - HP: 3,527,673
  - Shields: 32
  - Speed: 494
  
  KEY MECHANICS (FROM SPREADSHEET):
  - Non-weakness attacks: DODGED + HP restored!
  - At 3 BP: Can act TWICE for one turn
  - Acedia attack: Fire Res Down + cleanses HIS debuffs + removes YOUR buffs
  - HP <50%: ~18k regen per turn
  
  STRATEGY:
  1. ONLY use weakness attacks (Polearm/Bow/Fire/Ice/Light)
  2. Break before BP reaches 3 to prevent double action
  3. After Acedia: reapply buffs immediately
  4. Below 50%: need sustained DPS to outpace 18k regen
  
  SUSTAINED FIGHT:
  - Regen at 50% makes this a war of attrition
  - Don't let fight stall below 50%

required_roles:
  - role: debuffer
    priority: required
    reason: "Cleansed by Acedia - reapply during break"
  - role: healer
    priority: required
    reason: "Survive double actions"
  - role: buffer
