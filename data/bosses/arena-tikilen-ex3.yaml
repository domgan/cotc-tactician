  EX3 CHARACTERISTICS (VERIFIED FROM SPREADSHEET):
  - Tikilen HP: 4,460,250 | Mercenaries: 2,721,450 each
  - Total HP: ~10M
  - Tikilen shields: 36→18 at 40% HP
  - Mercenary shields: 26/25
  
  KEY MECHANICS:
  - Last Stand (40% HP): Only CRITICAL HITS shave shields!
  - Mercenary Counter Mode: They gain PRIORITY (act first) when active
  - Watch turn order to detect counter mode activation
  
  CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
  - 4000+ HP per character
  - Guaranteed crit source (Sonia, Haanit, Linde) for Last Stand
  - Full damage stacking (all 5 categories)
  - Consider turtle strategy
  
  RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
  1. Stack 30% DEF + 30% ATK debuff
  2. Dodge tank for single-target attacks
  3. Guaranteed crit for Last Stand phase
  4. Watch mercenary turn order - if they go first, counter mode is active!
  5. Kill mercenaries first if struggling with counters
