# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX3 Aoi is the ultimate sword master challenge.
  
  EX3 CHARACTERISTICS (VERIFIED FROM SPREADSHEET):
  - HP: 66,087,252 (66M!)
  - Shield: 56
  - Speed: 1036
  - 3 actions per turn
  
  KEY MECHANICS:
  - Dual mode system (Light vs Dark attacks)
  - Dark mode: 3x RT Sword (-10% ult per hit), 6x RT Dark (-1 BP per hit), AoE Blind
  - At Full BP: Uses BOTH modes + 4 ACTIONS - extremely deadly!
  - If HP >50% and hasn't used BP attack: locks ALL weaknesses + restores ALL BP
  
  STRATEGY:
  1. Push HP below 50% quickly to prevent weakness lock + BP restore
  2. Break before Full BP at all costs (4-action turn is devastating)
  3. Bring BP preservation/recovery (6x RT Dark attack removes BP fast)
  4. Have status cleanse for Blindness
  
  REQUIREMENTS:
  - Top-tier hybrid breakers (Morena, Kagemune, Bargello)
  - Full buff/debuff stacking
  - Cover tank with status immunity
  - BP management (anticipate BP drain)
  - Massive DPS across multiple break windows
  
  SPECIAL: Morena's shield shave without attacking
  is extremely valuable for avoiding counter triggers.
  
  SPECIAL: Kagemune's evasion-ignoring attacks
  work during Shiyou stance!
