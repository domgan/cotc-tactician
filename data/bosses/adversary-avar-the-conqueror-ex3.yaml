  EX3 variant - EXTREME difficulty.
  
  EX3 CHARACTERISTICS:
  - HP: 3,880,440
  - Shields: 32
  - Speed: 390
  
  UNIQUE MECHANICS (FROM SPREADSHEET):
  - Battle start & break recovery: Gains 7x weakness charges (Staff/Fan/Lightning/Dark)
  - Weaknesses REMOVED when counter reaches 0 (reapplied after next break)
  - Physical Counterattack stance - counters with single hit targeting attacker
  - WHEN BROKEN: Dispels all ATK and DEF buffs from your entire party!
  
  STRATEGY:
  1. Use Staff/Fan/Lightning/Dark to hit weaknesses while counter active
  2. Track weakness counter (7 hits per break cycle)
  3. Physical attacks trigger counters - use dodge tank or high-HP units
  4. CRITICAL: Save buff skills for AFTER break (boss dispels buffs on break)
  5. Break → Reapply buffs → Damage window
  
  BUFF TIMING:
  - Don't stack buffs before break - they'll be dispelled!
  - Apply buffs immediately after boss is broken
  - Damage during break window with fresh buffs

  - role: debuffer
    priority: required

  - role: healer
