# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY (EX2 SPECIFIC)
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX2 variant with ~394x HP.
  
  Key changes from base:
  - Much higher HP (5,713,000)
  - Higher shield count (31)
  - Much higher speed (501)
  - 2 actions per turn
  
  CRITICAL:
  - Stack all 5 damage multiplier categories
  - Speed tuning required for debuffers
  - Consider dodge tank (H'aanit EX, Canary)
  
  Recommended HP per character: 3500+
  
  Fight notes:
  - A4 serenoa hitting about 6000 HP with 15% active edef up, 30% active edef up, and 20% e atk down on herminia can probably tank the first 4x light and then from there more damage mitigation = always takes it
  - very annoying fight if you can't 2 break, but otherwise easy
  - SP sap per turn is 25% of max SP
  - i'm sure someone could figure out exactly how many turns you have in between each break, but with sonia it's not that bad anyway
