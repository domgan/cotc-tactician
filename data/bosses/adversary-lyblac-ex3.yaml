# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY (EX3 SPECIFIC)
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX3 variant - MAXIMUM DIFFICULTY.
  
  EX3 CHARACTERISTICS:
  - HP: 5,467,528
  - Shields: 40
  - Speed: 382
  
  KEY MECHANICS (FROM SPREADSHEET):
  - Battle start: 9x Physical Dodge buff
  - Sleep (Sword), Blindness (Sword/Light), Paralysis (AoE Light)
  - After break recovery: LOCKS Lightning and Dark weaknesses
  - HP ≤40%: Gains all stat buffs
  - HP ≤30%: Boost Mode - 5x AoE Light!
  
  STRATEGY:
  1. Use elemental or strip physical dodges early
  2. After first break, rely on Sword/Dagger/Wind/Light (no Thunder/Dark)
  3. Push through 40% and 30% quickly or prepare for massive buffs
  4. Paralysis immunity recommended
  
  CRITICAL:
  - Either speedkill (Solon + Primrose EX) or full turtle
  - Stack all buff/debuff categories to 30%
  - Fiore EX Cover or dodge tank essential
  - May take 50-100+ turns without optimal setup
  
  Recommended HP per character: 4000+
