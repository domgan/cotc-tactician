# FIGHT NOTES
# ===========================================================================
# A4 serenoa hitting about 6000 HP with 15% active edef up, 30% active edef up, and 20% e atk down on herminia can probably tank the first 4x light and then from there more damage mitigation = always takes it
# very annoying fight if you can't 2 break, but otherwise easy
# SP sap per turn is 25% of max SP
# i'm sure someone could figure out exactly how many turns you have in between each break, but with sonia it's not that bad anyway
