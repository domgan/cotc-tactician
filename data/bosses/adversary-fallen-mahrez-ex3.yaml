  EX3 variant - MAXIMUM DIFFICULTY.
  
  EX3 CHARACTERISTICS (FROM SPREADSHEET):
  - HP: 4,382,599
  - Shields: 31
  - Speed: 373
  
  KEY MECHANICS:
  - Sleep attack and AoE that swaps frontrow to backrow
  - HP 85-45%: NULLIFY ALL - becomes completely immune!
    → Must kill "Vile Memory" wisp, keep "Beloved Memory" alive to dispel
  - HP <45%: 3 ACTIONS per turn + ALL stat buffs (Atk/Def/MAtk/MDef/Crit/Speed)
  
  STRATEGY:
  1. Push HP from 100% to below 45% as fast as possible
  2. If stuck in Nullify phase, kill Vile Memory immediately
  3. After 45%, expect massive damage with 3 actions + full buffs
  4. Tank positioning may be disrupted by backrow swap attack
  
  CRITICAL:
  - Either speedkill (Solon + Primrose EX) or full turtle
  - Stack all buff/debuff categories to 30%
  - Fiore EX Cover or dodge tank essential
  - May take 50-100+ turns without optimal setup
  
  Recommended HP per character: 4000+
