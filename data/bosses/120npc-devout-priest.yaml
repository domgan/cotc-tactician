# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  Devout Priest (Pious Priest) is a MULTI-ENEMY 120 NPC fight.
  
  ⚠️ CHALLENGE AT NIGHT!
  Night battle gives:
  - ALL allies start with +5 BP
  - Enemies have P.DEF/E.DEF down (3 turns)
  - Debuffs stack with battle abilities!
  
  ENEMIES:
  1. Pious Priest (敬虔な神官) - MAIN
     Shield: 22→38, Weak: Polearm, Bow, Wind
     
  2. Witty Priest (機転が利く神官)
     Shield: 20, Weak: Bow, Staff, Lightning, Wind
     Has Multi-Hit Shield Lock
     
  3. Wide-Field Priest (視野が広い神官)
     Shield: 23, Weak: Polearm, Fan, Ice, Light
     ⚠️ COUNTERS AOE ATTACKS!
  
  ⚠️ CRITICAL: NO AOE UNTIL WIDE-FIELD PRIEST IS DEAD!
  Counter = super powerful attack + force back row switch.
  Exception: PDodge accessories on healers can dodge counter.
  
  RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
  
  1. Break ALL 3 enemies at the SAME time
     - Use Sonia for multi-target breaking
     - Break on Turn 4
     
  2. First break: Kill Wide-Field Priest + Witty Priest
     - This removes AOE counter threat
     - Main boss shields increase to 38 after break
     
  3. Use Simurgh Turn 6
     - Main boss uses "聖火の導きを我に" (full heal/buff)
     - Then uses BP attack Turn 7
     
  4. Block BP Attack with Temenos
     - "月白のヴェール" applies "Attribute attacks fail"
     - Completely blocks Divine Punishment Meteor
     
  5. Post-Phase-2: Debuffs cleansed at turn end
     - Apply debuffs SAME TURN you use them
     - Use passive buffs (can't be cleansed)
     
  BREAK TIMING (after adds dead):
  - Break every 3 turns: Turns 8, 11, 14
  
  TURN 10: Boss removes front row buffs
  - Send DPS to back row before Turn 10
  
  TEAM EXAMPLE (Game8):
  Front: Magnolia, Temenos, Primrose EX, Kilns
  Back: Lucetta, Agnea, Odette, Solon
  
  ALTERNATIVE (StofMilan - SazEX/Oskha):
  Front: Rinyuu, Kilns, SazEX, Leon
  Back: Oskha, Tatloch, Shana, Nephti

common_mistakes:
  - "Using AOE attacks while Wide-Field Priest is alive"
  - "Not breaking all 3 enemies simultaneously"
  - "Applying debuffs too early (cleansed at turn end)"
  - "Not using Temenos to block BP attack"
  - "Not switching DPS to back row before Turn 10 buff removal"
