# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY (EX1 SPECIFIC)
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX1 variant with ~315x HP.
  
  Key changes from base:
  - Higher HP (4,570,400)
  - Higher shield count (29)
  - Higher speed (456)
  - 2 actions per turn
  
  Recommended HP per character: 3000+
  
  Fight notes:
  - A4 serenoa hitting about 6000 HP with 15% active edef up, 30% active edef up, and 20% e atk down on herminia can probably tank the first 4x light and then from there more damage mitigation = always takes it
  - very annoying fight if you can't 2 break, but otherwise easy
  - SP sap per turn is 25% of max SP
  - i'm sure someone could figure out exactly how many turns you have in between each break, but with sonia it's not that bad anyway
