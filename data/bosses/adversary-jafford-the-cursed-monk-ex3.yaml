# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX3 variant - EXTREME difficulty with mode switching.
  
  EX3 CHARACTERISTICS:
  - HP: 2,311,702 + Priest add
  - Shields: 28
  - Speed: 433
  
  KEY MECHANICS (FROM SPREADSHEET):
  - If top add alive: Weaknesses change every 2 turns
  - TWO MODES:
    1. Ouma Guardian: Phys/Ele Resistance Up, revives Priest at end of turn!
    2. Ouma Strike: Resistance removed - YOUR DAMAGE WINDOW
  - Full BP (Guardian): Stillness to frontrow (disables skills)
  - Full BP (Strike): 3x AoE Light + CHARM
  
  STRATEGY:
  1. Track mode switching (Guardian vs Strike)
  2. Save damage for Ouma Strike mode (no resistance)
  3. DON'T kill Priest during Guardian mode - it revives at 100%!
  4. Kill Priest during Strike mode, OR ignore and kill Jafford
  5. Charm immunity ESSENTIAL for Strike boost attack
  6. Break before Full BP in both modes
  
  PRIEST MANAGEMENT:
  - Guardian mode: Priest revives at 100% if killed!
  - Strike mode: Kill Priest during this window
  - Alternative: Just focus on Jafford
