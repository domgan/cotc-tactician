  EX3 Sly Leader Lloris - Weapon resistance fight.
  
  EX3 CHARACTERISTICS:
  - Leader HP: 1,143,210 + add
  - Shields: 30
  - Speed: 481
  
  KEY MECHANICS (FROM SPREADSHEET):
  - Battle start: Leader gains ALL weapon resistance!
  - Sword, Polearm, Dagger, Axe, Bow, Staff, Fan all resisted
  - Must use ELEMENTAL attacks for damage (or break first)
  - Weapon resistance REMOVED when leader is broken
  
  ADD BEHAVIOR:
  - If adds alive when leader is broken, adds gain Cover
  - Cover protects leader from some attacks
  
  STRATEGY:
  1. Use elemental attacks for initial damage
  2. Break leader to remove weapon resistance
  3. Then weapon attacks become effective
  4. Consider killing adds before breaking leader
