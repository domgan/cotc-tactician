      - DISPELS all party buffs every turn!
      - At Varkyn HP ≤50%: Gains double actions
      - Weakness Counter: Ultra-high damage when hit on weakness (HP ≤50%)
      - BP drain and SP drain attacks
      
      COUNTERS:
      - DO NOT USE BUFFS after Spirit Stone appears!

  - name: "Buff Dispel"
    description: |
      Spirit Stone dispels ALL party buffs at end of every turn.
      Defensive buffs and attack buffs are useless!
      
      COUNTER: Only use DEBUFFS on enemies.
      Semi-permanent buffs and auto-regen still work.
      
  - name: "Musou Munen (HP <35%)"

      At HP <35%, Varkyn uses "Musou Munen":
      - Permanent E.ATK buff
      - Switches to extremely dangerous attack pattern
      - Uses powerful aura attacks
      
      COUNTER: Break Varkyn just before/after 35% and burst down immediately.

  - Scheming Dancer: Buffs enemies, Light RES debuff
  
  PHASE 2 - Spirit Stone Active:
  - Spirit Stone has INFINITE shields, cannot be broken!
  - DISPELS ALL BUFFS every turn - DO NOT USE BUFFS!
  - Only use DEBUFFS (attack debuffs on Varkyn)
  - Track weakness cycle: Staff → Sword → Ice
  
  PHASE 3 - Varkyn HP ≤50%:
  - Spirit Stone gains double actions
  - Spirit Stone gains WEAKNESS COUNTER (instant kill!)
  - NEVER hit Spirit Stone's current weakness!
  - Single target attacks are safe; watch AoE!
  
  PHASE 4 - Varkyn HP <35% (Musou Munen):
  - Varkyn gets permanent E.ATK buff
  - Extremely dangerous attacks
  - Break and burst immediately!
  - Have back row attackers ready if front row SP drained
