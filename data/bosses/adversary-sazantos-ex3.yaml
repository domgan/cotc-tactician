# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY (EX3 SPECIFIC)
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX3 variant - MAXIMUM DIFFICULTY.
  
  EX3 CHARACTERISTICS:
  - HP: 2,242,594
  - Shields: 22
  - Speed: 312
  
  UNIQUE MECHANIC (FROM SPREADSHEET):
  - Battle start: Boss debuffs ALL your allies (all stats down)
  - HOWEVER: At end of turn 3, ally Sazantos removes all debuffs, 
    fully heals HP/SP, and starts acting at end of following turns!
  - Just survive the first 3 turns!
  
  KEY MECHANICS:
  - Def/MDef Up for 4 turns at battle start
  - AoE Sword (Blindness), AoE Dark (Sleep)
  - HP ≤60%: Locks ALL weaknesses except ONE RANDOM weakness
  
  STRATEGY:
  1. Survive turns 1-3 (defensive stance, heal through initial damage)
  2. Turn 3: Sazantos ally saves you with full heal + debuff cleanse
  3. After 60% HP: Adapt to random remaining weakness
  4. Bring flexible weakness coverage or single-element focus
  
  CRITICAL:
  - Either speedkill (Solon + Primrose EX) or full turtle
  - Stack all buff/debuff categories to 30%
  - Fiore EX Cover or dodge tank essential
  
  Recommended HP per character: 4000+
