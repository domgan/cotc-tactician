# ===========================================================================
# SPECIAL MECHANICS
# ===========================================================================
special_mechanics:
  - name: "Forced Swap"
    description: |
      Glossom's "Impact" and "Impact Barrage" force swap target to back row.
      Swapped character cannot act on that turn.
      
      COUNTER: Use physical evasion tank (Tressa, Fiore EX).
      Equip Beast summons with physical evasion buff.
      
  - name: "Double Actions (HP ≤50%)"
    description: |
      At HP ≤50%, Glossom permanently gains double actions.
      Combined with buffs, attacks become very dangerous.
      
      COUNTER: Kill adds before pushing Glossom below 50%.
      
  - name: "Weakness Lock (HP ≤25%)"
    description: |
      At HP ≤25%, "Martial God Elegant Stance" locks polearm/axe weakness.
      Only DARK attacks can shave shields until Glossom is broken!
      
      COUNTER: Bring dark multi-hit attackers (Primrose, Ninarana, Zenia).
      Thieves with ignore-weakness shield shave also work.

# TEAM REQUIREMENTS

required_roles:
  - role: tank
    priority: required
    reason: "Physical EVASION tank for forced swap attacks"
    
  - role: healer
    priority: required
    reason: "Auto-regen healer to survive double actions"
    
  - role: breaker
    priority: required
    reason: "Dark AoE hits all enemies consistently"
    
  - role: debuffer
    priority: required
    reason: "P.ATK/E.ATK debuffs essential for survival"

recommended_weakness_coverage:
  - dark      # Consistent through all phases
  - axe       # All 3 weak, but locked at 25%
  - sword     # Dancers only
  - wind      # Dancers only

# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  Complex 3-enemy arena fight with forced swap and weakness lock mechanics.
  
  SHARED WEAKNESSES: Dark (consistent!), Axe (locked at 25%)
  
  PHASE 1 (HP 100-50%):
  - Kill adds FIRST before pushing Glossom below 50%
  - Use dark/axe AoE to damage all enemies
  - Maintain P.ATK/E.ATK debuffs on Glossom
  
  PHASE 2 (HP 50-25%):
  - Glossom gains DOUBLE ACTIONS
  - Watch for "Taking Battle Stance" → Destruction Dance
  - Physical evasion tank is crucial
  
  PHASE 3 (HP 25-0%):
  - "Martial God Elegant Stance" LOCKS polearm/axe weakness
  - ONLY DARK can shave shields until break!
  - Burst Glossom down during break window
  
  TANK RECOMMENDATION:
  Use physical EVASION tank (Tressa, Fiore EX) instead of stat tank.
  Forced swap attacks are physical - evasion bypasses them.
  Beast summons with evasion buff help (Cat Black, etc.)
