general_strategy: |
  EX3 Divine Beast Lutiya - 120 NPC fight with special resistance.
  
  EX3 CHARACTERISTICS:
  - Lutiya HP: 1,503,810
  - Hammy HP: 2,543,050 (higher than main boss!)
  - Third add HP: 2,398,041
  - Speed: 535
  
  CRITICAL MECHANIC (FROM SPREADSHEET):
  - SUCCESSIVE STRIKE RESISTANCE
  - The more times you hit per attack, the LESS damage each hit does!
  - Multi-hit attacks become inefficient
  - Use NUKE/single-hit attacks for maximum damage!
  
  NOTE: From this NPC onwards, all 120 NPCs have this resistance.
  
  STRATEGY:
  1. Prioritize single-hit, high-potency attacks
  2. Multi-hit breakers still useful for shield shave
  3. For damage: 1-hit nukes > multi-hit spam
  4. Hammy has more HP than Lutiya - decide kill order
  
  OPTIMAL DPS:
  - Solon (single-hit ultimate)
  - High-potency single attacks
  - Avoid relying on multi-hit for damage
