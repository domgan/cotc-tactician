# ===========================================================================
# FIGHT NOTES
# ===========================================================================
# Fox's Dispel does NOT remove "Damage Up" buffs from Richard and Bargello or Regen. Very helpful!
#
# Most efficient strategies (in order):
# 1: One-break kill
# 2: If you have enough shield shaving, continuously break the Adventurer after the first one.
#    Managing SP is a bit of an issue, but with Sonia, not much of one.
# 3: Otherwise deal with the RNG of the fox
#
# Consider row swapping on key turns to deal with the RNG of the fox

# TEAM REQUIREMENTS

required_roles:
  - role: breaker
    priority: required
    reason: "Need efficient shield shaving for continuous breaks"

  - role: dps
    priority: required
    reason: "Strong damage for one-break or quick kills"

  - role: buffer
    priority: recommended
    reason: "Richard/Bargello damage buffs aren't dispelled!"

general_strategy: |
  Unique fight with Fox providing RNG-based support to Adventurer.
  
  KEY INSIGHT: Fox's Dispel does NOT remove:
  - Richard's "Damage Up" buff
  - Bargello's "Damage Up" buff
  - Regen effects
  
  STRATEGIES (best to worst):
  1. One-break kill - burst down Adventurer in first break
  2. Continuous breaking - keep Adventurer broken, use Sonia for SP
  3. Deal with Fox RNG - row swap on key turns
  
  WEAKNESSES:
  - Adventurer: Sword, Dagger, Lightning, Light
  - Fox: Cannot be broken (0 shields)
  
  Fox has very low HP but high speed. Can be ignored or killed for safety.
