# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY (EX3 SPECIFIC)
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX3 variant - MAXIMUM DIFFICULTY.
  
  Key changes from base:
  - Extreme HP (4,590,781)
  - Maximum shield count (43)
  - Very high speed (511)
  - 3 actions per turn from early fight
  
  CRITICAL:
  - Either speedkill (Solon + Primrose EX) or full turtle
  - Stack all buff/debuff categories to 30%
  - Fiore EX Cover or dodge tank essential
  - May take 50-100+ turns without optimal setup
  
  Recommended HP per character: 4000+
  
  Fight notes:
  - Gains permanent 30k hp/turn regen at around 50% health or below
  - Probably won't be doing this until my spear DPS is good enough to 1 break from 50% (2,295,390) HP, no real point in doing this otherwise since relatively easy fight to understand
  - Action pattern and actions don't seem to change based on HP%?
