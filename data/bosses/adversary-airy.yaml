# Gains permanent 30k hp/turn regen at around 50% health or below
# Probably won't be doing this until my spear DPS is good enough to 1 break from 50% (2,295,390) HP, no real point in doing this otherwise since relatively easy fight to understand
# Action pattern and actions don't seem to change based on HP%?
