# STRATEGY (EX3 SPECIFIC)
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX3 variant - MAXIMUM DIFFICULTY.
  
  Key changes from base:
  - Extreme HP (6,024,565)
  - Maximum shield count (34)
  - Very high speed (412)
  - 3 actions per turn from early fight
  
  CRITICAL:
  - Either speedkill (Solon + Primrose EX) or full turtle
  - Stack all buff/debuff categories to 30%
  - Fiore EX Cover or dodge tank essential
  - May take 50-100+ turns without optimal setup
  
  Recommended HP per character: 4000+
  
  Fight notes:
  - Continuous ~9696 HP regen when unbroken, probably higher for A3 characters
  - Continuous 10% HP and 3% SP sap on front row
  - Otherwise doesn't seem all that bad once you solve the initial phys dmg reduction problem
  - Ironically EX H'aanit doesn't work as a tank, because she's too likely to dodge the hits that would un charm her. Sucks, because she compresses a lot of useful things for this fight
