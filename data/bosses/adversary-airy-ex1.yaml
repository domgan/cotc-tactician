# STRATEGY (EX1 SPECIFIC)
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX1 variant with ~34x HP.
  
  Key changes from base:
  - Higher HP (3,060,521)
  - Higher shield count (39)
  - Higher speed (426)
  - 2 actions per turn
  
  Recommended HP per character: 3000+
  
  Fight notes:
  - Gains permanent 30k hp/turn regen at around 50% health or below
  - Probably won't be doing this until my spear DPS is good enough to 1 break from 50% (2,295,390) HP, no real point in doing this otherwise since relatively easy fight to understand
  - Action pattern and actions don't seem to change based on HP%?
