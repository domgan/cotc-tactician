# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY (EX2 SPECIFIC)
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX2 variant with ~13x HP.
  
  Key changes from base:
  - Much higher HP (5,020,471)
  - Higher shield count (32)
  - Much higher speed (378)
  - 2 actions per turn
  
  CRITICAL:
  - Stack all 5 damage multiplier categories
  - Speed tuning required for debuffers
  - Consider dodge tank (H'aanit EX, Canary)
  
  Recommended HP per character: 3500+
  
  Fight notes:
  - Continuous ~9696 HP regen when unbroken, probably higher for A3 characters
  - Continuous 10% HP and 3% SP sap on front row
  - Otherwise doesn't seem all that bad once you solve the initial phys dmg reduction problem
  - Ironically EX H'aanit doesn't work as a tank, because she's too likely to dodge the hits that would un charm her. Sucks, because she compresses a lot of useful things for this fight
