# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY (EX1 SPECIFIC)
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX1 variant with ~10x HP.
  
  Key changes from base:
  - Higher HP (4,016,377)
  - Higher shield count (30)
  - Higher speed (344)
  - 2 actions per turn
  
  Recommended HP per character: 3000+
  
  Fight notes:
  - Continuous ~9696 HP regen when unbroken, probably higher for A3 characters
  - Continuous 10% HP and 3% SP sap on front row
  - Otherwise doesn't seem all that bad once you solve the initial phys dmg reduction problem
  - Ironically EX H'aanit doesn't work as a tank, because she's too likely to dodge the hits that would un charm her. Sucks, because she compresses a lot of useful things for this fight
