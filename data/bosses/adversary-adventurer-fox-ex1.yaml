# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY (EX1 SPECIFIC)
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX1 variant with ~4.7x HP from base.
  
  Key changes from base:
  - Higher HP (2,516,732 Adventurer, 45,942 Fox)
  - Higher shield count (26)
  - Higher speed (309 Adventurer, 431 Fox)
  - 2 actions per turn
  
  KEY INSIGHT: Fox's Dispel does NOT remove:
  - Richard's "Damage Up" buff
  - Bargello's "Damage Up" buff
  - Regen effects
  
  STRATEGIES (best to worst):
  1. One-break kill - burst down Adventurer in first break
  2. Continuous breaking - keep Adventurer broken, use Sonia for SP
  3. Deal with Fox RNG - row swap on key turns
  
  Fox has 0 shields - CANNOT BE BROKEN!
  
  Recommended HP per character: 3000+

  - role: breaker
    priority: required

  - role: buffer
    priority: recommended

  - role: debuffer
    priority: required
    reason: "Stack attack debuffs (30% cap)"

  - sword
  - dagger
