# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY (EX3 SPECIFIC)
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX3 variant - MAXIMUM DIFFICULTY.
  
  Key changes from base:
  - Extreme HP (4,530,117 Adventurer, 82,695 Fox)
  - Very high speed (370 Adventurer, 517 Fox!)
  - 3 actions per turn from early fight
  
  CRITICAL:
  - Either speedkill (Solon + Primrose EX) or full turtle
  - Stack all buff/debuff categories to 30%
  - Fiore EX Cover or dodge tank essential
  - Fox is EXTREMELY fast (517) and will act first!
  
  KEY INSIGHT: Fox's Dispel does NOT remove:
  - Richard's "Damage Up" buff
  - Bargello's "Damage Up" buff
  - Regen effects
  
  BEST STRATEGY:
  One-break kill with full Solon + Primrose EX setup.
  Use Richard/Bargello for buffs that survive dispel.
  
  Recommended HP per character: 4000+
