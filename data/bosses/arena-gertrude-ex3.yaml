# STRATEGY NOTES (EX3 specific)
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EXTREME difficulty - endgame content requiring meta units.
  
  EX3 SPECIFIC CHALLENGES:
  - HP estimated at 50-80 million
  - Very high speed (500+ likely)
  - Triple actions at HP <33% with massive damage
  - Heal Slash recovers significant HP
  
  REQUIRED APPROACH:
  1. SPEEDKILL (recommended):
     - Stack ALL 5 damage categories multiplicatively
     - Solon (100% potency) + Primrose EX (extension)
     - Must kill before HP <33% or have Fiore EX Cover
     - Aim for 2-break kill
     
  2. TURTLE (slower but safer):
     - 30% DEF buff + 30% ATK debuff (stack both)
     - Fiore EX Cover is almost mandatory
     - 4000+ HP on all characters
     - 50-100+ turns expected
  
  CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
  - Fiore EX for Cover (provoke doesn't work!)
  - 4000+ HP per character minimum
  - Instant healing available
  - Single-hit DPS only (multi-hit useless)
