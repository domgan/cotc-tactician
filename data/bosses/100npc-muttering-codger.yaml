# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  Easiest 100 NPC but has ENRAGE TIMER - must kill before turn 14.
  
  Key mechanics:
  1. Turn ~7: Opens magic book (2 actions/turn)
  2. "Takes Battle Stance" → next turn = Ultimate Magic (huge damage)
  3. Turn 14: Gets Serious (permanent status immunity)
  4. Turn 15+: OVERKILL damage (instant party wipe)
  
  Strategy:
  1. Stack buffs/debuffs turns 1-5
  2. Break around turn 6-7
  3. Full burst during break window
  4. If not dead, second break cycle BEFORE turn 14
  
  Counters:
  - Gigant Bash: Tank with provoke or spread HP
  - Ultimate Magic: Break before it hits, or heal/shield up
  - Use dagger/wind multi-hit characters for fast breaking
