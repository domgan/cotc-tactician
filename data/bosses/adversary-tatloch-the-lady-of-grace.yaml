# FIGHT NOTES
# ===========================================================================
# Continuous ~9696 HP regen when unbroken, probably higher for A3 characters
# Continuous 10% HP and 3% SP sap on front row
# Otherwise doesn't seem all that bad once you solve the initial phys dmg reduction problem
# Ironically EX H'aanit doesn't work as a tank, because she's too likely to dodge the hits that would un charm her. Sucks, because she compresses a lot of useful things for this fight
