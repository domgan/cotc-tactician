# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY (EX2 SPECIFIC)
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX2 variant with ~716x HP.
  
  Key changes from base:
  - Much higher HP (2,004,788)
  - Higher shield count (24)
  - Much higher speed (426)
  - 2 actions per turn
  
  CRITICAL:
  - Stack all 5 damage multiplier categories
  - Speed tuning required for debuffers
  - Consider dodge tank (H'aanit EX, Canary)
  
  Recommended HP per character: 3500+
  
  Fight notes:
  - Entire fight can be completely dodged with any phys sidestep, but will need to quickly take out at least 1 ad for that to be sustainable
  - With careful play, Aedelgard + Sidestep Pet + Hammy lets you hold out long enough to nuke down the ads, from which point you can't lose
