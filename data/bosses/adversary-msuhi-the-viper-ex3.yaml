# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY (EX3 SPECIFIC)
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX3 variant - MAXIMUM DIFFICULTY.
  
  Key changes from base:
  - Extreme HP (3,127,095 main, 1,553,128 thieves)
  - Maximum shield count (54 main!)
  - Very high speed (478)
  - 3 actions per turn from early fight
  
  CRITICAL:
  - Either speedkill (Solon + Primrose EX) or full turtle
  - Stack all buff/debuff categories to 30%
  - Fiore EX Cover or dodge tank essential
  - 54 shields is brutal - need strong multi-hit breakers
  
  M'suhi swaps between two weakness sets:
  - Set 1: Bow, Staff, Fan, Fire, Light
  - Set 2: Sword, Axe, Tome, Ice, Lightning
  
  Recommended HP per character: 4000+
