  EX3 variant - EXTREME difficulty with Terror mechanics.
  
  EX3 CHARACTERISTICS:
  - HP: 2,568,559 (main) + 2 adds
  - Shields: 38
  - Speed: 452
  
  KEY MECHANICS (FROM SPREADSHEET):
  - First action: Terror to 2 random targets
  - WHEN TERRORIZED: Sometimes reduces HP to 1 and removes Terror
  - After first break: Creates zone (backrow swap = damage) + Terror frontrow
  - Full BP (pre-2nd break): Sword AoE that REMOVES Terror
  - Full BP (post-2nd break): Thunder AoE with -3 BP
  
  TERROR MANAGEMENT:
  - Cleanse Terror immediately or expect HP reduction to 1
  - Don't let Terror linger - it triggers HP=1 attack
  - Ironically, Full BP attack removes Terror (but damages)
  
  STRATEGY:
  1. Bring Terror immunity or instant cleanse
  2. Be ready to heal from 1 HP
  3. After first break: DON'T swap rows (zone damage)
  4. Stay in frontrow after first break
  5. Manage BP drain in later phases
