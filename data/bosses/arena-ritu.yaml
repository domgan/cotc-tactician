special_mechanics:
  - name: "Guardian Stance (Steadfast Swordsman)"
    description: |
      Steadfast Swordsman uses "Guardian Stance" to protect Ri'tu.
      While active, attacks on Ri'tu are redirected to the Swordsman.
      
      COUNTER: Kill Steadfast Swordsman FIRST!
      
  - name: "Pursuit Attack (HP ≤50%)"
    description: |
      At HP ≤50%, Ri'tu gains "Dual Blade Stance":
      - After every action, pursues last target with additional attack
      - AoE pursuit hits random target
      - Permanent effect
      
      COUNTER: Use stat-based tank (not evasion for multi-hit).
      Auto-regen healing is essential.
      
  - name: "Slashing Rock Form (HP ≤25%)"
    description: |
      At HP ≤25%, "Slashing Rock Form" activates:
      - Pursuit attack damage significantly increases
      - Permanent speed buff
      - Spams "Severing" (絶) - extremely powerful single attacks
      
      COUNTER: Evasion tank CAN work for single-hit "Severing".
      Burst Ri'tu down during break window.

# ===========================================================================
# TEAM REQUIREMENTS
# ===========================================================================
required_roles:
  - role: tank
    priority: required
    reason: "Stat-based tank for multi-hits; evasion works for Severing spam"
    
  - role: healer
    priority: required
    reason: "Auto-regen essential for pursuit attacks"
    
  - role: breaker
    priority: required
    reason: "Wind AoE hits all enemies consistently"
    
  - role: debuffer
    priority: required
    reason: "P.ATK debuffs reduce dangerous physical attacks"

recommended_weakness_coverage:
  - wind      # Consistent for all 3 enemies
  - light     # Ri'tu + Carefree Dancer
  - fire      # Ri'tu only
  - ice       # Steadfast Swordsman only

# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  Complex 3-enemy arena fight with pursuit attack mechanics.
  
  EQUIPMENT: Equip P.DEF gear! Almost all attacks are physical.
  
  SHARED WEAKNESS: Wind (hits all 3 enemies)
  
  KILL ORDER:
  1. Steadfast Swordsman FIRST (protects Ri'tu with Guardian Stance)
  2. Carefree Dancer second (P.ATK/CRIT buffs are dangerous)
  3. Ri'tu last
  
  PHASE 1 (HP 100-50%):
  - Use wind AoE to shave all shields
  - Kill adds in order above
  - Stat-based tank recommended (2-5 hit attacks)
  
  PHASE 2 (HP 50-25%):
  - "Dual Blade Stance" - pursuit attacks after every action
  - Much more damage incoming
  - Keep P.ATK debuffs and auto-regen active
  
  PHASE 3 (HP 25-0%):
  - "Slashing Rock Form" - increased pursuit damage + speed
  - "Severing" spam (single powerful hits) - evasion works here
  - Burst Ri'tu down during break window
  
  TANK RECOMMENDATION:
  Use stat-based tank for multi-hit phase (H'aanit EX, Gilderoy).
  Evasion tank can work for "Severing" spam at low HP.
