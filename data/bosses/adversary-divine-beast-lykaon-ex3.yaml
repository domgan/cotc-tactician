general_strategy: |
  EX3 variant - MAXIMUM DIFFICULTY.
  
  Key changes from base:
  - Extreme HP (4,549,249)

  - 3 actions per turn from early fight
  
  CRITICAL:

  Recommended HP per character: 4000+
  
  Fight notes:
  - Goat8 doesn't have any info on this one so I'll try to pick up the slack
  - Attacks:  a range of 1-3x dark rt, i don't think they cause any status ailments but i had some immunnities so couldnt say for sure 3x rt phys, 2t bleeding per hit 1x aoe dark + 2t blindness  aura: doesn't seem to appear above 50% HP but i wouldn't know, i broke too fast to tell. 8x rt phys, might have some status ailment  below 50%: 2x aoe dark + 2t blindness  when returning from break, does an aoe terror as its action. don't know how many turns because i had rinyuu active
  - all attacks are fairly weak, 30 patk/eatk down + 15% passive pdef from tatloch was enough to handle all aoe's. ex h'aanit + hammy + sidestep pet easily handles the rest of it
