# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX2 Aoi is significantly different from Ura!
  HP: ~30 million, Shield: 50
  
  ⚠️ CRITICAL CHANGE: STARTS IN RYUTEN FROM TURN 1!
  
  The Turn 2 break option from Ura version DOESN'T WORK in EX2!
  Stance timing is shifted forward by 2 turns.
  
  EX2 TIMING:
  - Turn 1-3: Ryuten (defensive) ← Starts immediately!
  - Turn 4-5: Shiyou (offensive) ← Break at Turn 4!
  - Turn 6+: Same cycling pattern
  
  Turn 5 in EX2 also hits BACK ROW (not just front)!
  Much more dangerous than Ura version.
  
  STRATEGY:
  1. Cannot do Turn 2 break
  2. Must survive until Turn 4
  3. Break at Turn 4 start before Shiyou attacks
  4. Need to deal 30M damage across break windows
  
  REWARD: アオイの英傑印 x1
