  EX3 variant - EXTREME difficulty with shield trap mechanic.
  
  EX3 CHARACTERISTICS:
  - HP: 4,749,879
  - Shields: 38 (becomes 99 at 60%, then 9 at 50%!)
  - Speed: 441
  
  KEY MECHANICS (FROM SPREADSHEET):
  - Has priority-granting attack + 6x RT attack
  - After break recovery: 6-turn COUNTER that reduces BP by 2!
  - HP ≤60%: Shields become 99 (UNBREAKABLE!)
  - HP ≤50%: Boost Mode - AoE, deals 99,999 to HIMSELF, shields → 9
  
  THE 60% HP TRAP:
  - If you trigger 60% but not 50%, shields become 99
  - This is essentially unbreakable
  - SOLUTION: Push straight from above 60% to below 50%!
  - Don't let fight stall between 60-50%
  
  POST-BREAK COUNTER:
  - Lasts 6 turns after break recovery
  - Each counter reduces YOUR BP by 2
  - Either wait it out or break again
  
  STRATEGY:
  1. First phase: Normal breaking and damage
  2. When approaching 60% HP: BURST THROUGH to 50%
  3. At 50%: Boss hurts himself, shields drop to 9
  4. After break: Be careful of 6-turn counter phase
