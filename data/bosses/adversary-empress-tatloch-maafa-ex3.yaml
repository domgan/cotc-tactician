# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY (EX3 SPECIFIC)
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX3 variant - MAXIMUM DIFFICULTY.
  
  DUAL BOSS FIGHT:
  - Tatloch: 3,905,601 HP, 32 shields
  - Maa'fa: 4,791,573 HP, 28 shields (~5M HP!)
  
  CRITICAL:
  - Either speedkill (Solon + Primrose EX) or full turtle
  - Stack all buff/debuff categories to 30%
  - Fiore EX Cover or dodge tank essential
  - Maa'fa's 2-action phase at 25% HP (~1.2M) is very dangerous
  - Rosters without Leon and/or A2 unlikely to skip Maa'fa's 2-action phase
  
  PHASE 1: Both bosses alive
  - Tatloch drains 99,999 HP from Maa'fa each turn
  - Focus on Maa'fa first - has ~5M HP!
  - Maa'fa gains regen at ~50% HP, 2 actions at ~1.2M HP
  
  BOSS WEAKNESSES:
  - Tatloch: Polearm, Axe, Staff, Lightning
  - Maa'fa: Axe, Bow, Staff, Fire, Ice
  - Shared: Axe, Staff (hit both!)
  
  Recommended HP per character: 4000+
