# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY (EX3 SPECIFIC)
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX3 Ceraphina - Status ailment nightmare with an EXPLOIT!
  
  EX3 CHARACTERISTICS:
  - HP: 3,649,026
  - Shields: 31
  - Speed: 350
  
  EXPLOIT (FROM SPREADSHEET):
  - Kilns and Signa's passive debuffs CANNOT BE REMOVED!
  - Ceraphina cannot cleanse these specific debuffs
  - BRING KILNS AND/OR SIGNA for permanent debuffs!
  
  MASS STATUS ATTACK:
  At battle start and after each break recovery, applies to frontrow:
  - Poison, Bleeding, Silence, Sleep, Paralysis, Terror, Weakness, Blindness
  - That's 8 STATUS AILMENTS at once!
  
  OTHER ATTACKS:
  - 2x RT Ice (Comatose)
  - Dark/Light (Comatose)
  - Self cleanse + frontrow stat debuff
  
  STRATEGY:
  1. BRING KILNS AND/OR SIGNA (permanent debuffs!)
  2. Status immunity or instant full cleanse ESSENTIAL
  3. Prepare for status bomb after each break
  4. She cleanses other debuffs - don't rely on normal debuffers
  
  Recommended HP per character: 4000+
