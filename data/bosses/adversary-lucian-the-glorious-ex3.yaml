# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX3 variant - EXTREME difficulty with complex mechanics.
  
  EX3 CHARACTERISTICS:
  - HP: 4,268,484
  - Shields: 12 (low but cycling weaknesses)
  - Speed: 472
  
  PERMANENT EFFECT:
  - Weakness counter reduces 5% SP and deals Dark damage constantly!
  
  KEY MECHANICS (FROM SPREADSHEET):
  - Weakness cycling on break (two sets above 75%, final two below 75%)
  - HP <50%: 3 ACTIONS + cleanses debuffs + applies Def/EDef Down
  - NASTY ATTACKS: Silence, Charm, BP -3, Row Swap
  - Full BP (>25%): 100% SP drain OR 3x Light + Ele Attack Lock
  - Full BP (<25%): Full party physical nuke
  
  STRATEGY:
  1. SP management is critical (permanent SP drain)
  2. Charm immunity ESSENTIAL (3x RT Charm)
  3. Break before Full BP at all costs
  4. After 50% HP, debuffs only work during break window
  5. Track weakness rotation pattern
  
  CRITICAL STATUS EFFECTS:
  - Charm (3x RT) - bring immunity
  - Silence (AoE Fire) 
  - Elemental Attack Lock (boost attack)
