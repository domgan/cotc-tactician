# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY (EX2 SPECIFIC)
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX2 variant with ~6.6x HP from base.
  
  Key changes from base:
  - Much higher HP (3,523,424 Adventurer, 64,318 Fox)
  - Higher speed (339 Adventurer, 474 Fox)
  - 2 actions per turn
  
  CRITICAL:
  - Stack all 5 damage multiplier categories
  - Speed tuning required for debuffers
  - Consider dodge tank for survival
  
  KEY INSIGHT: Fox's Dispel does NOT remove:
  - Richard's "Damage Up" buff
  - Bargello's "Damage Up" buff
  - Regen effects
  
  STRATEGIES:
  1. One-break kill with full buff stacking
  2. Continuous breaking with Sonia for SP
  
  Recommended HP per character: 3500+

required_roles:
  - role: breaker
    priority: required
    reason: "Need efficient shield shaving for continuous breaks"
  - role: dps
    priority: required
    reason: "Strong damage for one-break or quick kills"
  - role: buffer
    priority: recommended
    reason: "Richard/Bargello damage buffs aren't dispelled!"
  - role: debuffer
    priority: required
    reason: "Stack attack debuffs (30% cap)"
  - role: healer
    priority: required
    reason: "Survive multi-action turns"

recommended_weakness_coverage:
  - sword
  - dagger
  - lightning
  - light
