# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY (EX1 SPECIFIC)
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX1 variant with ~104x HP from base.
  
  Key changes from base:
  - Higher HP (2,084,730 main, 1,035,419 thieves)
  - Much higher shield count (50 main!)
  - Higher speed (399)
  - 2 actions per turn
  
  M'suhi swaps between two weakness sets:
  - Set 1: Bow, Staff, Fan, Fire, Light
  - Set 2: Sword, Axe, Tome, Ice, Lightning
  
  Build a team that can hit BOTH sets reliably!
  
  Thieves are weak to: Axe, Bow, Fan, Fire, Light
  (Fire and Light hit both Thieves and M'suhi Set 1)
  
  Recommended HP per character: 3000+
