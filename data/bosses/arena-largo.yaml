# ===========================================================================
# SPECIAL MECHANICS
# ===========================================================================
special_mechanics:
  - name: "Robot Cover System"
    description: |
      Robots with COVER protect Largo from attacks!
      While Cover is active, attacks on Largo hit the robot instead.
      Cover is disabled when the robot is broken.
      
      COVER ROBOTS BY STAGE:
      - Stage 1: Type I
      - Stage 2: Type III
      - Stage 3: Type V
      - Stage 4: Type Red (then Type Blue takes over!)
      
  - name: "Thunder Crossbow Aura Attack"
    description: |
      Most dangerous attack: "Thunder Crossbow" (single target, instant-kill tier)
      
      COUNTER: Use PROVOKE + elemental evasion!
      - Provoke works on Largo
      - Use Beast summon with elemental evasion
      - Or use Hammy to grant evasion
      
  - name: "Debuff While Covered"
    description: |
      While robots are covering Largo, attacks don't hit him.
      BUT non-attack debuffs (like "Anti-Attack II") DO work!
      
      ESSENTIAL: Keep 30% P.ATK/E.ATK debuffs on Largo at all times!
      Use 2 different non-attack debuff skills.
      
  - name: "Kill Both Stage 4 Robots Together"
    description: |
      When you kill ONE of Red/Blue, the other takes over Cover,
      and Largo gets triple actions!
      
      STRATEGY: Damage both Red and Blue to near-death,
      then kill BOTH in the same turn!
      
  - name: "Stage Skip Behavior"
    description: |
      If you push Largo through multiple HP thresholds in one break,
      robots appear one stage at a time, each lasting one turn before
      being replaced by the next stage.
      
      This can cause chaotic situations - plan carefully!

# STRATEGY
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  Very complex arena fight with 4 stages of robot adds.
  
  EQUIPMENT: Balanced P.DEF/E.DEF (mixed attack types)
  
  KEY RULES:
  1. Robots with COVER block attacks on Largo!
  2. Non-attack debuffs (Anti-Attack II) STILL work on Largo!
  3. Kill Cover robot first to damage Largo
  4. Use provoke + elemental evasion for Thunder Crossbow
  5. Kill Red+Blue robots TOGETHER to avoid early triple actions
  
  STAGE BY STAGE:
  Stage 1 (initial): Kill Type I first (Cover), then attack Largo+Type II
  Stage 2 (HP 85%): Kill Type IV first (heals), then Type III
  Stage 3 (HP 65%): Kill Type VI first (heals), then Type V
  Stage 4 (HP 45%): Damage BOTH to near-death, kill together!
  
  THUNDER CROSSBOW HANDLING:
  - Appears at HP <65%
  - Use provoke tank with elemental evasion Beast summon
  - Or Hammy to grant evasion
  
  HP THRESHOLD NOTES:
  - HP 85% → Stage 2 robots
  - HP 65% → Stage 3 robots
  - HP 45% → Stage 4 robots
  - HP 25% (or Red/Blue dead) → Largo triple actions!
