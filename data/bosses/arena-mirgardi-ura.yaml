      Track HP carefully for weakness changes:
      100-90%: Sword, Axe, Ice
      90-65%: Polearm, Tome, Ice (cycles on break recovery)
      65-35%: Axe, Lightning, Light (cycles on break recovery)

required_roles:
  - role: breaker
    priority: required
    reason: "MUST break every 3 turns for BP and Death Sentence"
  - role: healer
    priority: required
    reason: "Heavy sustained damage, need HP regen"
  - role: debuffer
    priority: required
    reason: "Stack 30% P.ATK down to survive"
  - role: dps
    priority: required
    reason: "Need DPS that covers multiple weakness sets"
  - role: tank
    priority: strongly_recommended
    reason: "Absorb single-target attacks"

recommended_weakness_coverage:
  - ice       # Works 100-65%
  - axe       # Works 100-90% and 65-35%
  - polearm   # Works 90-65%
  - lightning # Works 65-35%
  - light     # Works 65-35%

# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  Mirgardi (Ura) is MUCH harder than base. Key threat: BP attack and Death Sentence.
  
  CRITICAL MECHANIC - BP ATTACK:
  - Mirgardi has BP gauge (max 5)
  - At MAX BP: Uses 稲穂崩し (~10,000 damage to front row)
  - Break reduces BP by 3
  - YOU MUST BREAK EVERY 3 TURNS OR WIPE
  
  DEATH SENTENCE (HP ≤65%):
  - 3-count death timer on front row
  - Break removes it
  - Forces 3-turn break cycles
  
  WEAKNESS PHASES (complex!):
  - 100-90%: Sword, Axe, Ice
  - 90-65%: Polearm, Tome, Ice (also cycles on break recovery)
  - 65-35%: Axe, Lightning, Light (cycles on break recovery)  
  - 35-0%: Hidden! Cycles between all patterns
  
  HP GAUGE ESTIMATES:
  - 100-90%: First bar segment
  - 90-65%: Large green portion
  - 65-35%: Yellow portion
  - 35-0%: Red portion
  
  RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
  1. Build team that can break in ALL phases
  2. Ice works until 65% (longest coverage)
  3. After 65%: Need axe/lightning/light coverage
  4. Stack Gloria/Tatloch for sustain OR speed-clear
  
  SAMPLE TEAM (Endurance):
  - Nephti, Sarisa (debuff/break)
  - Cyrus, Rinyuu (ice damage/healing)
  - Tatloch, Gloria (sustain tank)
  - Signa, Viola (debuff/support)
  
  SAMPLE TEAM (Speed Clear):
  - Primrose EX, Richard (buffs)
  - Solon, Agnea (damage amp)
  - Odio-O, Viola (debuff/DPS)
  - Ringabel, Mabel (damage)

common_mistakes:
  - "Letting BP reach MAX - instant wipe"
  - "Not breaking within 3 turns of Death Sentence"
  - "Missing weakness phase transitions"
  - "Not preparing for hidden phase at 35%"
