      At HP ≤40%, Tikilen activates "Last Stand":
      - Shields reduce from 25 to 7
      - ONLY CRITICAL HITS can shave shields!
      - Effect is permanent until Tikilen is broken
      - After break, shields return to 25
      
      COUNTER STRATEGIES:
      1. Bring high-CRIT hunters (Scarecrow, Jilmeira, Herminia)
      2. Use guaranteed crit skills (Haanit, Zenia)
      3. Use Sonia's "White Grape" for guaranteed crit buff
      4. Use Beast summons with crit buff (Linde)
      
  - name: "Physical Counter Stance"
    description: |
      Both mercenaries use Physical Counter Stance.
      When active, physical attacks trigger a powerful sword counter!
      
      COUNTER: Use elemental attacks when counter is active.
      Track turn patterns to avoid using physical during counter turns.
      
  - name: "Shield Repair"
    description: |
      Skilled Mercenary heals Tikilen's shields by 3 when Tikilen is at 1-6 shields.
      Does NOT activate during Last Stand effect.
      
      COUNTER: Kill Skilled Mercenary first, or burst Tikilen during break.
      
  - name: "HP-Based Behavior Pattern"
    description: |
      Tikilen's action pattern changes based on HP thresholds:
      - 100-80%: Pattern A
      - 80-60%: Pattern B  
      - 60-40%: Pattern C
      - 40-0%: Pattern D (Last Stand active)
      
      Pattern changes mid-turn if HP crosses threshold!

# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  Complex 3-enemy arena fight with unique mechanics.
  
  SHARED WEAKNESSES: Bow, Light (hit all 3 enemies!)
  
  KEY MECHANICS:
  1. Last Stand (背水の陣) at 40% HP:
     - Shields 25→7, but ONLY CRITS can shave!
     - Bring high-crit hunters or guaranteed crit skills
     
  2. Physical Counter Stance:
     - Both mercenaries use this periodically
     - DO NOT use physical attacks during counter turns!
     - Use light/lightning magic instead
     
  3. Shield Repair:
     - Skilled Mercenary heals Tikilen's shields when low
     - Consider killing Skilled Mercenary first
  
  RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
  1. Stack P.ATK/E.ATK debuffs (30%) on Tikilen
  2. Use bow/light AoE multi-hits to break all enemies
  3. Avoid physical when counter stance is active
  4. Prepare guaranteed crit for Last Stand phase
  5. Tank absorbs random/single attacks
  
  TEAM COMP PRIORITIES:
  - Auto-regen healer (Rinyuu, Primrose EX)
  - Tank (Gilderoy, Devin)
  - Debuffer (Viola, Tithi, Sarisa)
  - Bow/light multi-hitters (Scarecrow, Eliza, Odette, Rondo)
  - Crit specialists for Last Stand (Haanit, Sonia)
