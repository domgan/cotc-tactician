# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  Complex boss with shield scaling and weakness cycling.
  
  Key insight: LIGHT WEAKNESS IS CONSTANT
  - Build around light DPS
  - Other weaknesses cycle, but light is always active
  
  Shield phases:
  1. 28 shields - Normal fight
  2. 99 shields - SURVIVAL MODE (can't break)
  3. 40 shields - Opportunity to burst
  4. 20 shields - Best burst window
  
  Strategy:
  1. Stack buffs/debuffs during early phases
  2. Survive the 99 shield phase
  3. All-out burst at 40/20 shield phases
  4. Light-focused team strongly recommended
