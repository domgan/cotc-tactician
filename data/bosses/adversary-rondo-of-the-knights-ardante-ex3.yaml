general_strategy: |
  EX3 variant - EXTREME difficulty with complex phase mechanics.
  
  EX3 CHARACTERISTICS:
  - HP: 8,959,991
  - Shields: 41
  - Speed: 363
  
  KEY MECHANICS (FROM SPREADSHEET):
  - Battle start: Locks Sword/Fan/Ice weaknesses
  - Turn 2: Rondo unlocks weaknesses
  - First boost attack is single target (before first break)
  - After break recovery: Locks Sword + random weakness, gains 2 actions
  - Sometimes after break: Wisp summon mode instead
    → Only locks Sword
    → Summons 2 wisps
    → Gains Elemental Counter (gives 2 BP when hit with elements!)
  
  STRATEGY:
  1. Turns 1-2: Use Staff/Bow/Lightning/Wind (Sword/Fan/Ice locked)
  2. After turn 2: All weaknesses available
  3. First boost attack is ST - tank handles it
  4. After first break: Watch for patterns
     - If Sword + random locked → 2 actions mode
     - If wisps spawn → avoid elemental attacks!
  5. Elemental Counter feeds BP - use physical during wisp phase
  
  WISP MANAGEMENT:
  - Kill wisps quickly
  - DON'T use elemental attacks when counter active (restores 2 BP!)
  - Use physical attacks during wisp phase
