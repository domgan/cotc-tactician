  EX1 version with ~2x HP and higher shields.
  
  Key changes from base:
  - Tikilen shields: 32→14 (was 25→7)
  - Higher mercenary shields
  - Faster enemies (speed tuning needed)
  
  Same strategy applies:
  - Bow/light for AoE weakness coverage
  - Avoid physical during counter stance
  - Guaranteed crit for Last Stand phase
  - 3000+ HP recommended
