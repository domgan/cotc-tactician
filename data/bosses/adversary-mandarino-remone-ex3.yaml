# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX3 Mandarino & Remone - Duo with weakness swapping.
  
  EX3 CHARACTERISTICS:
  - Mandarino HP: 4,796,107 | Remone HP: 2,081,788
  - Total HP: ~6.9M
  - Shields: 27/22
  - Speed: 358
  
  KEY MECHANIC (FROM SPREADSHEET):
  - If BOTH are alive, at end of turn OR after "Syncing breath with..."
  - Weaknesses ROTATE between enemies!
  - Remone gets Mandarino's weaknesses, Mandarino gets Remone's
  
  STRATEGY:
  1. Track weakness rotation carefully
  2. Consider killing one quickly to stop rotation
  3. Remone has lower HP - may be easier first target
  4. If rotation confuses you, just brute force one down
