  EXTREME difficulty - complex multi-stage fight.
  
  EX3 SPECIFIC:

  - Robots have massive HP pools

  REQUIRED STRATEGY:
  - 4000+ HP per character
  - Full defensive stacking for triple phase
  - Consider ignoring robots and burst Largo
  
  ALTERNATIVE:
  - Kill robots in order to delay triple
  - Red/Blue death triggers triple - delay this
  - Long fight (100+ turns with turtle)
  
  SPEEDKILL APPROACH:
  - Ignore robots, burst Largo
  - Stack all 5 damage categories
  - Must survive triple action phase
