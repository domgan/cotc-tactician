  EX3 variant - EXTREME difficulty with HP recovery.
  
  EX3 CHARACTERISTICS:
  - HP: 8,959,991 + add
  - Shields: 41 (+4 per break)
  - Speed: 363
  
  KEY MECHANICS (FROM SPREADSHEET):
  - First 3 breaks: AoE + FULL HP RECOVERY + 4 extra shields!
  - HP ≤50%: Regen 4-5% HP per turn (massive sustain)
  - Fire Res Down attack: Cleanses HER debuffs AND removes YOUR buffs
  - Fatal Sentence: ST death timer
  - After 2nd break: Sleep/Silence/Can't Switch combo!
  
  CRITICAL ISSUE:
  - Boss fully recovers HP on first 3 break recoveries!
  - Must deal enough damage in break window to push through
  - After 4th break, normal recovery
  
  STRATEGY:
  1. Stack massive damage for each break window
  2. Expect HP to fully restore after first 3 breaks
  3. Keep buffs ready to reapply after Fire Res Down
  4. Fatal Sentence requires cleanse or fast break
  5. After 2nd break: bring full status cleanse
  
  SUSTAINED FIGHT:
  - This is a marathon, not a sprint
  - Regen at 50% means you need constant DPS
  - Consider whether to speedkill first break or turtle

required_roles:
  - role: debuffer
    priority: required
    reason: "Will be cleansed by boss - reapply during break"
  - role: healer
    priority: required
    reason: "Handle Fatal Sentence and status effects"
  - role: buffer
    priority: required
    reason: "Reapply after Fire Res Down dispel"
  - role: dps
    priority: required
    reason: "Need massive burst for break windows"
  - role: breaker
    priority: required
    reason: "41+ shields requires dedicated breaking"

recommended_weakness_coverage:
  - polearm
  - staff
  - tome
