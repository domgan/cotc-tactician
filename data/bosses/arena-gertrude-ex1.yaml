# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY NOTES (EX1 specific)
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  Same mechanics as base Gertrude but with:
  - Higher HP (~2x)
  - Higher shield count (12→15 instead of 9→12)
  - Higher speed (speed tuning needed)
  
  Key strategy remains the same:
  - Multi-hit attacks useless (2 shields max per action)
  - Use single-hit dagger/bow/fire attacks
  - Fiore EX Cover works (not provoke)
  - Stack debuffs on Turn 1 (free turn)
  
  RECOMMENDATION: Ensure 3000+ HP on all characters.
