  EX1 variant with ~573x HP.
  
  Key changes from base:
  - Higher HP (1,603,831)
  - Higher shield count (22)
  - Higher speed (388)
  - 2 actions per turn
  
  Recommended HP per character: 3000+
  
  Fight notes:
  - Entire fight can be completely dodged with any phys sidestep, but will need to quickly take out at least 1 ad for that to be sustainable
  - With careful play, Aedelgard + Sidestep Pet + Hammy lets you hold out long enough to nuke down the ads, from which point you can't lose
