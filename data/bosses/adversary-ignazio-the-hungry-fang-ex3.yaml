general_strategy: |
  EX3 Ignazio the Hungry Fang - WEAKNESS-ONLY fight.
  
  EX3 CHARACTERISTICS:
  - HP: 3,210,700
  - Shields: 37
  - Speed: 470
  
  CRITICAL MECHANIC (FROM SPREADSHEET):
  - If you attack with NON-WEAKNESS, boss DODGES and RESTORES HP!
  - ONLY use attacks that hit weaknesses (Polearm/Axe/Fire/Wind/Dark)
  - Any neutral damage is counterproductive
  - Effect removed on break
  
  OTHER MECHANICS:
  - 10x Physical attack with POISON PER HIT (10 stacks!)
  - Fire Res Down: Cleanses HIS debuffs + removes YOUR buffs
  - Terror to frontrow (3 turns)
  
  STRATEGY:
  1. Build team with ONLY weakness-hitting attacks
  2. No flexible attackers with wrong elements
  3. Poison immunity or instant cleanse CRITICAL
  4. Buff timing: reapply after Fire Res Down strips them
  
  TEAM BUILDING:
  - Polearm/Axe physical attackers
  - Fire/Wind/Dark elemental attackers
  - AVOID bringing any non-weakness options

  - role: debuffer
    priority: required
