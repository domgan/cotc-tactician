# SPECIAL MECHANICS
# ===========================================================================
special_mechanics:
  - name: "Rotating Weakness Lock"
    description: |
      Yan Long LOCKS 2 of 3 weaknesses every turn!
      Rotation: Sword → Polearm → Light → Sword...
      
      Turn 1: Only SWORD works
      Turn 2: Only POLEARM works
      Turn 3: Only LIGHT works
      (Repeats)
      
      Bring characters with sword, polearm, AND light attacks!
      Or use ignore-weakness shield shave (thieves).
      
  - name: "Weakness Counter"
    description: |
      Hitting a LOCKED weakness triggers counter!
      Counter: Yan Long gets +1 action next turn (3 actions!)
      
      Track the rotation carefully!
      
  - name: "Debuff Clear Every Turn"
    description: |
      "Evil Purge: Turn" clears ALL debuffs at end of every turn!
      
      Attack debuffs are USELESS for sustained damage reduction.
      
      COUNTER:
      - Use DEFENSE BUFFS on party instead!
      - At HP <50%: Speed-tuned debuffer can apply START of turn
        (debuff applies, then Yan Long acts, then cleared at end)
      
  - name: "Triple Actions (HP ≤50%)"
    description: |
      At HP ≤50%, "Fighting Body Technique" activates:
      - Triple actions (permanent)
      - Staff damage buff (permanent)
      - BUT weakness lock/counter is removed!
      
      Defense buffs + attack debuffs (speed-tuned) needed to survive.
      
  - name: "Provoke Immune"
    description: |
      Yan Long is IMMUNE to all status ailments including provoke!
      Normal tanks don't work.
      
      EXCEPTION: Fiore EX's "Cover" ability works.

# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  Complex arena fight with rotating weakness lock and debuff clear.
  
  EQUIPMENT: P.DEF gear (mostly physical attacks)
  
  PROVOKE IMMUNE! (Fiore EX Cover works)
  
  KEY MECHANICS:
  1. Weakness rotates every turn: Sword → Polearm → Light
  2. Debuffs cleared every turn - use DEFENSE BUFFS instead!
  3. Hitting locked weakness = +1 enemy action!
  4. At HP ≤50%: Triple actions but no weakness lock
  
  CROW HANDLING:
  - Kill crows FIRST (they buff/heal Yan Long)
  - Crows weak to AXE/TOME only
  - Cecily, Tatloch, Zenia for axe AoE
  
  ONE-BREAK KILL OPTION:
  If you can kill Yan Long before HP 85%, crows never spawn!
  Requires very specific high-damage setup.
  
  STANDARD APPROACH:
  1. Phase 1: Break Yan Long, push HP to trigger crows
  2. Kill crows with axe/tome attackers
  3. Continue Yan Long with sword/polearm/light rotation
  4. At HP <50%: Speed-tune debuffer to apply START of turn
  5. Keep defense buffs up for triple action phase
