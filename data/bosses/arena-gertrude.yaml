# ===========================================================================
# SPECIAL MECHANICS
# ===========================================================================
special_mechanics:
  - name: "Multi-Hit Shield Lock"
    description: |
      Gertrude ALWAYS has Multi-Hit Shield Lock active!
      Each character can only shave MAX 2 shields per action.
      
      Multi-hit attacks are USELESS for shield shaving!
      Use single-hit high-power attacks instead.
      
      EXCEPTIONS:
      - Continuous attacks (Herminia, Solon) can add +1 more
      - Effects that trigger separately from the attack
      
  - name: "Shield Increase Skip"
    description: |
      If you push Gertrude from >75% HP to <50% HP in one break,
      the 2nd Combat Drug (shield +3) is SKIPPED!
      
      This keeps shields at 9 instead of 12.
      
  - name: "Triple Actions (HP ≤33%)"
    description: |
      At HP ≤33%, Gertrude gains TRIPLE ACTIONS.
      Spams "Triple Bisection" and "Heal Slash" repeatedly.
      
      COUNTER: Use instant healing, not just auto-regen.
      
  - name: "Provoke Immune"
    description: |
      Gertrude is IMMUNE to all status ailments including PROVOKE!
      Normal provoke tanks DO NOT WORK.
      
      EXCEPTION: Fiore EX's "Cover" ability works (not provoke).

# ===========================================================================
# TEAM REQUIREMENTS
# ===========================================================================
required_roles:
  - role: debuffer
    priority: required
    reason: "Stack attack debuffs on turn 1 (Gertrude doesn't attack)"
    
  - role: healer
    priority: required
    reason: "Instant healing needed at HP <33%"
    
  - role: dps
    priority: required
    reason: "Single-hit high-power attacks (NOT multi-hit!)"

recommended_weakness_coverage:
  - dagger    # Best damage, debuff synergy with thieves
  - bow       # Good single-hit options
  - fire      # Elemental option

# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  Single enemy with MULTI-HIT SHIELD LOCK - unique mechanic!
  
  EQUIPMENT: P.DEF gear (almost all attacks are physical)
  
  KEY RULES:
  1. Multi-hit attacks are USELESS - use single-hit skills!
  2. Provoke tanks DON'T WORK (provoke immune)
  3. Stack debuffs on turn 1 (free turn, no attack)
  4. Use instant healing at HP <33%
  
  SHIELD SKIP TRICK:
  Push from >75% to <50% in one break to skip shield increase!
  
  BEST STRATEGY:
  - Turn 1: Stack 30% P.ATK debuff (free turn!)
  - Use single-hit dagger/bow/fire attacks
  - Continuous attackers (Herminia, Solon) get +1 bonus shield shave
  - At HP <33%: Use instant healing + burst finish
  
  FIORE EX OPTION:
  Fiore EX's "Cover" ability (not provoke) DOES work!
  Can complete-block attacks with proper timing.
