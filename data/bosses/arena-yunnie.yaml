# SPECIAL MECHANICS
# ===========================================================================
special_mechanics:
  - name: "Keep Hunter Alive Strategy"
    description: |
      The OPTIMAL strategy is to keep the Hunter alive as long as possible!
      
      1. Shave Hunter's shields to near-break (don't break)
      2. Attack Yunnie with SINGLE-TARGET attacks only
      3. When Hunter glows (charge-up), BREAK the Hunter
      4. During Hunter break, attack Yunnie
      5. Re-break Hunter within 2 turns of recovery
      6. Repeat until Yunnie dead
      7. Let Hunter self-destruct or kill it
      
      This prevents ALL other adds from appearing!
      
  - name: "Status Ailment Tank"
    description: |
      Most status attacks are SINGLE-TARGET.
      Use a 100% status immunity tank to absorb them!
      
      HOW TO MAKE:
      - Pair with "Pure White Apron" (Shelby A4) in back row
      - Character with "Status Immunity (Front Single)" passive
      - Total 100% status immunity
      
      Note: "Paralyze Rain" is AoE - need separate cure!
      
  - name: "AoE Counter (Merchant/Swordsman)"
    description: |
      Merchant and Swordsman have AoE COUNTER stance!
      Using AoE attacks triggers powerful counter attack.
      
      COUNTER: Use single-target attacks, or break them first.
      
  - name: "Rinyuu Trivializes Paralysis"
    description: |
      Rinyuu's "Gracious Prayer" provides semi-permanent paralysis immunity.
      If you have Rinyuu, AoE paralysis is not a problem.

# TEAM REQUIREMENTS
# ===========================================================================
required_roles:
  - role: tank
    priority: required
    reason: "100% status immunity tank for single-target ailments"
    
  - role: healer
    priority: required
    reason: "Need paralysis cure if no Rinyuu"
    
  - role: breaker
    priority: required
    reason: "Sword/axe/fan for Yunnie + Hunter"
    
  - role: debuffer
    priority: optional
    reason: "Ignore-weakness shield shave for Hunter control"

recommended_weakness_coverage:
  - sword     # Yunnie + multiple adds
  - axe       # Yunnie + multiple adds
  - fan       # Yunnie + Hunter + Apothecary

# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  Complex wave-based arena fight with status ailments.
  
  EQUIPMENT: P.DEF gear (almost all attacks are physical)
  
  OPTIMAL STRATEGY - KEEP HUNTER ALIVE:
  1. Don't kill the Hunter immediately!
  2. Shave Hunter shields to near-break (2-3 left)
  3. Attack Yunnie with SINGLE-TARGET attacks
  4. When Hunter charges up → Break Hunter
  5. During break, attack Yunnie freely
  6. Re-break Hunter within 2 turns of recovery
  7. Repeat until Yunnie dead (avoids all other adds!)
  
  STATUS AILMENT HANDLING:
  - Single-target ailments → 100% immunity tank
  - "Paralyze Rain" (AoE paralysis) → Rinyuu or status cure
  
  IF FIGHTING ALL WAVES:
  - Kill Merchant before Thief (has AoE counter)
  - Kill Apothecary quickly (heals Yunnie)
  - Watch for AoE counters on Merchant/Swordsman
