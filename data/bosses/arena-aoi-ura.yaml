# ===========================================================================
# STANCE SYSTEM (Turn-based, not HP-based)
# ===========================================================================
# Aoi has TWO main stances that cycle based on turns:
# 1. 流天の型 (Ryuten - Flowing Heaven): Defensive stance with evasion
# 2. 止揚の型 (Shiyou - Sublation): Offensive stance with POWERFUL attacks

phases:
  - phase_number: 1
    trigger: "Turns 1-2"
    behavior_changes: |
      No stance active yet.
      Normal attacks: Front row attack + P.DEF down, Single attack, Random 3-hit
    priority_actions: "Break on Turn 2 if going for 1-break kill"

  - phase_number: 2
    trigger: "Turns 3-5 (流天の型 - Ryuten)"
    behavior_changes: |
      DEFENSIVE STANCE with evasion:
      - Turn 3: Evade ELEMENTAL, multi-hit damage reduction, debuff clear at turn end
      - Turn 4: Evade PHYSICAL, multi-hit damage reduction, debuff clear at turn end
      - Turn 5: Evade ELEMENTAL, uses 星霜閃耀 (6-hit AoE + buff halving)
      
      Alternates between physical/elemental evasion each turn.
    priority_actions: |
      DO NOT break during Ryuten stance (multi-hit damage reduction).
      Turn 5 has dangerous 6-hit AoE - prepare defenses.

  - phase_number: 3
    trigger: "Turns 6-7 (止揚の型 - Shiyou)"
    behavior_changes: |
      OFFENSIVE STANCE - EXTREMELY DANGEROUS:
      - Damage up, always crits
      - Complete evasion of physical OR elemental (counters on evade!)
      - Counter: 6-hit AoE ignoring P.DEF/E.DEF up and damage reduction!
      
      Turn 6: Evade Physical + Counter
      Turn 7: Evade Elemental + Counter
    priority_actions: |
      BREAK ON TURN 6 BEFORE AOI ATTACKS!
      This is the key break timing - before Shiyou attacks land.
      DO NOT hit with attack type being evaded!

  - phase_number: 4
    trigger: "Turn 8+ (Cycling)"
    behavior_changes: |
      Pattern repeats:
      - 2 turns Ryuten (流天の型) with evasion cycling
      - 2 turns Shiyou (止揚の型) with deadly attacks
      
      After break recovery:
      - HP Green: 4 turns Ryuten → 2 turns Shiyou
      - HP Yellow: 2 turns Ryuten → 2 turns Shiyou
    priority_actions: "Break at start of Shiyou stance each cycle"

# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  Aoi (Ura) is a sword master with a complex stance cycling system.
  HP: ~10 million, Shield: 42
  
  ⚠️ PROVOKE DOESN'T WORK - USE COVER TANKS!
  
  STANCE SYSTEM:
  1. 流天の型 (Ryuten - Defensive):
     - Multi-hit damage reduction
     - Physical/Elemental evasion alternates
     - Debuffs cleared at turn end
     - DON'T BREAK DURING THIS STANCE
     
  2. 止揚の型 (Shiyou - Offensive):
     - Massive damage, always crits
     - Complete evasion + deadly counter
     - THIS IS YOUR BREAK WINDOW!
  
  KEY BREAK TIMING OPTIONS:
  Option A: Turn 2 Break (before Ryuten)
  - Need to break 42 shields in 2 turns
  - 1-break kill from here if possible
  - Use bow/hunter teams for fast shield shave
  
  Option B: Turn 6 Break (start of Shiyou)
  - Standard approach
  - Setup buffs during Ryuten (but they get halved at Turn 5)
  - Break RIGHT AS Shiyou starts, BEFORE Aoi attacks
  
  SHIYOU STANCE WARNINGS:
  - Turn 6: Evades Physical → USE ELEMENTAL ONLY
  - Turn 7: Evades Elemental → USE PHYSICAL ONLY
  - Counter triggers on evaded attacks!
  - Pursuit abilities (Midiya, Erika EX) trigger counter!
  
  SURVIVING 星霜閃耀 (Turn 5):
  - 6-hit AoE + buff halving on front row
  - Use P.DEF buffs, P.ATK debuffs, HP barriers
  - Move attackers to back row
  - Cecil can cover to protect one character
  
  RECOMMENDED TEAMS:
  
  Hybrid Physical/Elemental Breakers:
  - Bargello (dagger + wind)
  - Morena (staff + tome + wind)
  - Kagemune (dagger + fire/ice/wind)
  - Therese EX (staff + lightning/wind)
  - Sonia (dagger + wind)
  - Levina (dagger + tome + lightning/wind)
  - Chloe, Celtette, Scarecrow, Kargess (bow + element)
  
  Special: Morena can shave shields WITHOUT attacking!
  Special: Kagemune ignores evasion!
  
  Cover Tanks:
  - Cecil (can cover one character, protects from 6-hit)
  - Klick (cover + light)
  - Fiore EX (physical nullification!)
  - Olberic (cover + sword)
  
  Defense Support:
  - Therese EX, Hasumi (P.DEF + physical resist)
  - Lynette, Gloria, Agnea (P.DEF buff)
  - Black Priestess, Signa, Kilhn (P.ATK debuff)
  - Kazan (100% HP barrier)
  - Shana (damage reduction + immortality)
  - Pardis III (attack nullification)
  - Aira, Hami (physical evasion)

common_mistakes:
  - "Trying to break during Ryuten stance (wasted due to damage reduction)"
  - "Using physical attacks when Shiyou evades physical (Turn 6)"
  - "Using elemental attacks when Shiyou evades elemental (Turn 7)"
  - "Having pursuit abilities enabled during Shiyou"
  - "Not protecting attackers from buff halving at Turn 5"
  - "Using provoke tank instead of cover tank"
  - "Applying debuffs too early (cleared at Ryuten turn end)"
