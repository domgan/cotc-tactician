# TEAM REQUIREMENTS
# ===========================================================================
required_roles:
  - role: breaker
    priority: required
    reason: "Need axe/ice multi-hitters for all weakness phases"
  - role: healer
    priority: required
    reason: "Sustained damage from fan attacks"
  - role: debuffer
    priority: strongly_recommended
    reason: "P.ATK debuff reduces fan damage significantly"
  - role: dps
    priority: required
    reason: "Axe/ice DPS works across all phases"
  - role: tank
    priority: recommended
    reason: "Single-target attacks can be absorbed"

recommended_weakness_coverage:
  - axe   # Works in ALL phases
  - ice   # Works in ALL phases

# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  Mirgardi is a fan-wielding champion with weakness cycling mechanics.
  
  KEY INSIGHT: Axe and Ice work in ALL weakness phases!
  
  WEAKNESS PHASES:
  - 100-70%: Sword, Axe, Tome, Ice
  - 70-40%: Polearm, Axe, Ice, Lightning
  - Below 40%: Weakness changes on break recovery
  
  MECHANICS:
  1. Dragon Tail Point System:
     - Gains pts when attacked (not during break)
     - Pts increase fan attack power and resistance
     - Fan abilities consume pts, then add 3
     
  2. Speed Self-Debuff:
     - Slows down every turn (permanent)
     - Long fights = slower boss = easier to manage
     
  3. Living Dragon Slash:
     - Telegraphed charge attack
     - Break during charge to skip it
  
  RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
  1. Build team around Axe/Ice (works all phases)
  2. Stack P.ATK debuffs to reduce fan damage
  3. Break during charge-up to skip ultimate
  4. Boss gets slower over time - sustain is viable

common_mistakes:
  - "Using sword/tome attackers (locked after 70% HP)"
  - "Not tracking weakness phase transitions"
  - "Ignoring the charge-up attack"
