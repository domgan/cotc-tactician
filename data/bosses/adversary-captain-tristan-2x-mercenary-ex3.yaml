# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY (EX3 SPECIFIC)
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX3 variant - MAXIMUM DIFFICULTY.
  
  Key changes from base:
  - Extreme HP (2,405,746)
  - Maximum shield count (26)
  - Very high speed (465)
  - 3 actions per turn from early fight
  
  CRITICAL:
  - Either speedkill (Solon + Primrose EX) or full turtle
  - Stack all buff/debuff categories to 30%
  - Fiore EX Cover or dodge tank essential
  - May take 50-100+ turns without optimal setup
  
  Recommended HP per character: 4000+
  
  Fight notes:
  - Entire fight can be completely dodged with any phys sidestep, but will need to quickly take out at least 1 ad for that to be sustainable
  - With careful play, Aedelgard + Sidestep Pet + Hammy lets you hold out long enough to nuke down the ads, from which point you can't lose
