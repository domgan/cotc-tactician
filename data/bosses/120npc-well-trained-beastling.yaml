# MECHANICS
# ===========================================================================
mechanics:
  - name: "Break Weakness Addition"
    mechanic_type: passive
    trigger: "On break"
    target: all
    damage_type: none
    threat_level: low
    counter_strategy: |
      Axe and Bow weakness ONLY exists during break state.
      Use Axe/Bow DPS to maximize break window damage.
      Ochette's Arc Shot shaves shields regardless of weakness!

  - name: "Physical/Elemental Counter"
    mechanic_type: counter
    trigger: "Any attack before Special Dried Meat or I Won't Give Up"
    target: single
    damage_type: physical
    effects: ["forced_back_switch"]
    threat_level: high
    counter_strategy: |
      Counter forces attacker to back row (can't act during switch).
      Use dodge tanks or plan around forced switches.
      Put channelers behind dodge tanks, not attackers.

  - name: "BP Accumulation System"
    mechanic_type: passive
    trigger: "Various actions"
    target: all
    damage_type: none
    threat_level: critical
    counter_strategy: |
      Boss accumulates BP and uses "I'm Strong" at MAX BP.
      Breaking reduces threat. If broken, returns to start of loop.
      Early game is difficult due to Special Dried Meat HP recovery.

  - name: "I Won't Give Up Phase"
    mechanic_type: phase_transition
    trigger: "Around turn 10"
    target: all
    damage_type: none
    threat_level: high
    counter_strategy: |
      WAIT FOR THIS! Defense debuff applied to boss.
      No more Special Dried Meat HP recovery.
      This is your damage window!

  - name: "Turn 14 Enrage"
    mechanic_type: enrage
    trigger: "Turn 14 end"
    target: all
    damage_type: physical
    threat_level: critical
    counter_strategy: "Must kill before turn 14 or face 99,999 damage to all."

# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  Trained Beastman is a Level 120 NPC with BP mechanics and a turn 14 enrage.
  
  ⚠️ CHALLENGE AT NIGHT!
  Night battle gives:
  - ALL allies start with +5 BP
  - Boss has P.DEF/E.DEF down (3 turns)
  - Debuffs stack with battle abilities!
  
  PHASE 1 (Turns 1-10): Survival
  - Counter active: Forces attacker to back row
  - Special Dried Meat recovers ~40k HP at BP ≥5
  - Difficult to reduce HP in this phase
  - Break every 3 turns if possible (like Presidentialguard strategy)
  
  PHASE 2 (After "I Won't Give Up"): All-Out Attack!
  - Around turn 10, boss uses "I Won't Give Up"
  - Boss gets P.DEF/E.DEF down (permanent)
  - No more HP recovery from Special Dried Meat
  - Counter effects removed
  - THIS IS YOUR DAMAGE WINDOW!
  
  ENRAGE: Turn 14
  - Must defeat before turn 14
  - Uses "Master's Fury" - 99,999 to all
  
  BREAK WEAKNESS:
  - Normal: Fire, Ice, Lightning only
  - On Break: Axe and Bow ADDED
  - Use Ochette's Arc Shot (shaves regardless of weakness)
  - Canary and Ochette excellent for shield shaving
  
  RECOMMENDED TEAMS:
  
  Strategy 1: Elemental Focus (Cyrus/Isla/Nivelle)
  - Cyrus chain-casting with Fire/Ice/Lightning
  - Isla for Fire+Lightning damage
  - Nivelle for Lightning/Shock
  - Support around them for survival
  
  Strategy 2: Break Every 3 Turns (Presidentialguard)
  - Ochette (Arc Shot ignores weakness)
  - Canary (shield shaving + debuffs)
  - Signa (debuffs + fire)
  - Break trivializes damage output
  
  Sample Clear Team:
  Front: Signa, Augen, Sazantos, Fiore EX
  Back: Bargello, Alaune EX, Mabel, Richard

common_mistakes:
  - "Not challenging at night (miss +5 BP and def debuffs)"
  - "Trying to deal damage before I Won't Give Up phase"
  - "Ignoring counter mechanics (getting forced to back row)"
  - "Taking too long - turn 14 enrage is fatal"
  - "Not bringing Silence immunity (Turbulent Wind)"
