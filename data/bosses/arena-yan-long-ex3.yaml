general_strategy: |
  EXTREME difficulty - one of the hardest EX3 fights.
  
  EX3 CHARACTERISTICS (VERIFIED FROM SPREADSHEET):
  - HP: 7,346,082 (main) + Crows
  - Shield: 30
  - Debuff clear every turn (with exception!)
  
  KEY MECHANICS:
  - Rotating Weakness Lock: 2 of 3 weaknesses locked each turn
  - CRITICAL: Hitting LOCKED weakness = boss gains EXTRA ACTIONS!
  - Debuff clear at end of every turn
  
  EXPLOIT (BUG): Phys/Ele Res Down debuffs PERSIST through clear!
  - Use Viola/Heathcote for P.Res Down
  - Use E.Res Down debuffers 
  - These are your only reliable debuffs!
  
  CROW SUMMON: Triggers at HP <90%
  
  MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
  - Fiore EX Cover (provoke doesn't work!)
  - 4000+ HP per character
  - Track weakness rotation carefully
  - NEVER hit locked weaknesses!
  
  STRATEGY:
  - Use P.Res Down / E.Res Down (they persist!)
  - Stack buffs heavily (debuffs get cleared)
  - Max damage during break windows
  - Fiore EX protects team from staff attacks
  
  ALTERNATIVE:
  - Long turtle fight (100+ turns)
  - Focus on survival over damage
