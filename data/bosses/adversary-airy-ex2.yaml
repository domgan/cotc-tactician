# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY (EX2 SPECIFIC)
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX2 variant with ~43x HP.
  
  Key changes from base:
  - Much higher HP (3,825,651)
  - Higher shield count (41)
  - Much higher speed (468)
  - 2 actions per turn
  
  CRITICAL:
  - Stack all 5 damage multiplier categories
  - Speed tuning required for debuffers
  - Consider dodge tank (H'aanit EX, Canary)
  
  Recommended HP per character: 3500+
  
  Fight notes:
  - Gains permanent 30k hp/turn regen at around 50% health or below
  - Probably won't be doing this until my spear DPS is good enough to 1 break from 50% (2,295,390) HP, no real point in doing this otherwise since relatively easy fight to understand
  - Action pattern and actions don't seem to change based on HP%?
