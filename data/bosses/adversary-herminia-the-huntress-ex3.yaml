# STRATEGY (EX3 SPECIFIC)
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  EX3 variant - MAXIMUM DIFFICULTY.
  
  Key changes from base:
  - Extreme HP (6,855,600)
  - Maximum shield count (33)
  - Very high speed (547)
  - 3 actions per turn from early fight
  
  CRITICAL:
  - Either speedkill (Solon + Primrose EX) or full turtle
  - Stack all buff/debuff categories to 30%
  - Fiore EX Cover or dodge tank essential
  - May take 50-100+ turns without optimal setup
  
  Recommended HP per character: 4000+
  
  Fight notes:
  - A4 serenoa hitting about 6000 HP with 15% active edef up, 30% active edef up, and 20% e atk down on herminia can probably tank the first 4x light and then from there more damage mitigation = always takes it
  - very annoying fight if you can't 2 break, but otherwise easy
  - SP sap per turn is 25% of max SP
  - i'm sure someone could figure out exactly how many turns you have in between each break, but with sonia it's not that bad anyway
