# STRATEGY NOTES (EX2 specific)
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  Same mechanics as base Gertrude but with:
  - Much higher HP (~3x)
  - Higher shield count (14→17)
  - Much higher speed (speed tuning critical)
  
  EX2 SPECIFIC:
  - Need higher damage output (stack all 5 damage categories)
  - 3500+ HP recommended per character
  - Fiore EX Cover becomes very important
  - Consider turtle strategy if lacking DPS
  
  SPEEDKILL APPROACH:
  - Solon + Primrose EX for 2x ultimate damage
  - Full buff/debuff stacking (30% each category)
  - Kill in 2 breaks if possible
