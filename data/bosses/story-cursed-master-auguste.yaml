      ALL non-weakness attacks deal 1 damage.
      MUST hit weaknesses to deal damage.
      Dagger is never a weakness - dagger shield-break ignores damage still works.

      MUST break boss to reset/remove.
      Initial: 3 turns (Turn 1)
      Abyssal Zone: 5 turns (4 turns after 3rd break)
      
      Rehabilitate can remove Fatal Sentence!

      While Abyssal Zone is active:
      - DO NOT swap to back row unless you can break same turn
      - Back row swap = countdown -1

      BRING REHABILITATE!
      Status cleanse is nearly mandatory.
      Paralysis/Sleep/Silence are especially dangerous.

# ===========================================================================
# STRATEGY
# ===========================================================================
general_strategy: |
  Cursed Master Auguste (呪将アーギュスト) is a complex story boss with:
  - Weakness cycling on every break recovery
  - Fatal Sentence mechanics that require constant breaking
  - Non-weakness attacks deal 1 damage (MUST hit weaknesses)
  
  === WEAKNESS CYCLE ===
  1. Sword, Bow, Fan, Ice, Light
  2. Polearm, Bow, Staff, Fire, Wind
  3. Polearm, Fan, Fire, Wind, Light
  4. Sword, Bow, Staff, Ice (loops with 5)
  5. Sword, Ice, Wind, Light (loops with 4)
  
  === KEY SHARED WEAKNESSES ===
  - SWORD appears in phases 1, 4, 5 (3 of 5)
  - POLEARM appears in phases 2, 3 (2 of 5)
  - Build a team that covers Sword/Polearm OR multiple elements!
  
  === RECOMMENDED TEAM CORES ===
  Option 1: Sword + Polearm physical team
  - Covers all weakness phases
  - Olberic, Aedelgard good options
  
  Option 2: Ice + Fire elemental team
  - Ice: Phases 1, 4, 5
  - Fire: Phases 2, 3
  - Cyrus excellent for this
  
  Option 3: Wind + Ice elemental team
  - Wind: Phases 2, 3, 5
  - Ice: Phases 1, 4, 5
  
  === TURN 1-2 CRITICAL ===
  Turn 1: Boss uses Mass Fatal Sentence (3 turn countdown)
  Turn 2 End: Boss restores all BP
  Turn 3: If not broken, uses powerful BP attack
  
  → BREAK BEFORE TURN 3 OR FACE MASSIVE DAMAGE!
  
  === ABYSSAL ZONE (POST-BREAK 1) ===
  After first break, zone applies:
  - Front row gets Fatal Sentence
  - Swap to back = countdown -1
  - Swap to front = new Fatal Sentence
  
  → AVOID ROW SWAPS during zone unless you can break same turn!
  
  === BELOW 20% HP ===
  Boss stops changing weaknesses and creating Abyssal Zone.
  Once you reach 20%, the fight becomes MUCH easier.
  Push through the early phases!
  
  === STATUS AILMENT MANAGEMENT ===
  Boss spams: Poison, Paralysis, Blindness, Terror, Sleep, Silence
  BRING REHABILITATE! Soleil is particularly good here.
  
  === RECOMMENDED CHARACTERS (General Pool) ===
  Best: Olberic, Aedelgard, Cyrus
  Good: Sofia + Molu, Kouren, W'ludai
  Support: Soleil (Dark resist + status cleanse + Light weakness)
  
  === SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS ===
  - E.ATK Down 30% (reduces Dark damage)
  - E.DEF Up 30% (survive Dark attacks)
  - Rehabilitate (status cleanse)

common_mistakes:
  - "Building team that can't hit all weakness phases"
  - "Not breaking before Turn 3 (BP attack wipes)"
  - "Swapping rows during Abyssal Zone (accelerates Fatal Sentence)"
  - "Not bringing status cleanse (Rehabilitate)"
  - "Using dagger-only characters (dagger is never a weakness)"
  - "Ignoring the 20% HP threshold (fight becomes easy below this)"
  - "Not debuffing E.ATK (Dark attacks hit hard)"
