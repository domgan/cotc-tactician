usage_strategy: |
  A2 is "best girl" thief from the NieR Automata collaboration who functions as a versatile physical DPS. She has access to sword, dagger, and axe attacks with no elemental skills - purely physical damage. Her signature ability is Berserk Mode which allows her to use physical attack abilities twice in one turn, making her game-changing. She can break 6 shields of either sword or axe and nuke accordingly.

  - "Teams needing versatile physical coverage across multiple weapon types"
  - "Content where breaking multiple shield types is required"
  - "Situations where double skill activation provides massive damage"
  - "Players wanting the most versatile physical DPS from the collaboration"

  - "Berserk Mode causes 40% max HP damage each turn for 6 turns"
  - "Limited by skill usage requiring enemy weakness adjustment"
  - "Low elemental attack stat (80) due to pure physical focus"
  - "Time-limited collaboration availability"
