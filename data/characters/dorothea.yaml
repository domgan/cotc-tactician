  5-star version of Partitio with fire/polearm focus. Has 3-hit polearm attack and high potency attacks, but some skills have self-damage drawbacks. Provides front row physical attack buffs at full HP and enhanced self-healing.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube transcript
usage_strategy: |
  Dorothea is a fire merchant focused on killing heavily damaged enemies. She's essentially a 5-star version of Partitio but with mediocre stats. Her main value comes from high potency attacks and the 15% physical attack buff for front allies at full HP. However, she has self-damage drawbacks on some abilities and will be easily outclassed by future merchants.

best_use_cases:
  - "Teams needing fire and polearm damage coverage"
  - "Players lacking other 5-star merchants"
  - "Situations where high single-target polearm damage is needed"
  - "Teams that can maintain her at full HP for buff"

weaknesses:
  - "Mediocre stats compared to other 5-star units"
  - "Self-damage drawbacks on high potency skills"
  - "Time-limited availability making her less accessible"
  - "Will be easily outclassed by future merchant releases"
  - "Requires full HP maintenance for optimal performance"
