role_notes: |
  One of the best all-round breakers who can hit all eight physical weaknesses plus light. Still regarded as one of the best ultimate rechargers for entire party. Great for both new players (breaks all weaknesses) and seasoned players (ultimate battery). Mix between EX Primrose and Bargello with superior breaking capabilities. Global buffs made him amazing - all main attacking skills gained extra hit (5x to 6x) and became AoE. Key ultimate battery for future ultimate system upgrades.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube tutorial
usage_strategy: |
  Alrond is a luxury unit between must-have and optional. His main gimmick is supporting the team's ultimate bar with 40% restoration each turn plus immediate fill with his ultimate. For new players, he can break all physical weaknesses and light single-handedly. For seasoned players, he enables quicker ultimate cycling. His skills are similar to EX Primrose (ultimate support) and Bargello (ultimate battery) but with superior breaking capabilities. Consider holding pulls if you have EX Primrose or Bargello, as he's a Side Story memory traveler with future reruns.
