  Lightning warrior who feels standard compared to top-tier warriors like Richard. Has amazing 5-hit lightning attack (most hits currently) and auto-revive ability. Highest physical attack among warriors but suffers from low speed. Functions as standard warrior with good utility.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube transcript
usage_strategy: |
  Tytos is a lightning warrior with standard warrior capabilities plus some unique features. He has a 5-hit lightning attack that currently has the most hits in the game, making him attractive for breaking. His auto-revive ability gets him back to 100% HP/SP once per battle, and he can counter physical attacks while inflicting intimidation.

best_use_cases:
  - "Teams needing lightning coverage with high hit count attacks"
  - "Content where auto-revive provides survival advantage"
  - "Lightning-focused parties requiring intimidation debuffs"
  - "Situations where counter-attacks are valuable"
  - "Players wanting a reliable warrior with survival utility"

weaknesses:
  - "Feels standard compared to top-tier warriors like Richard"
  - "Low speed means he goes close to last in turn order"
  - "Warrior class is oversaturated with 12 five-star warriors"
  - "Limited time unit when better warriors like Lars and Joshua exist in general pool"
  - "Won't last long as future warriors will outclass him"
