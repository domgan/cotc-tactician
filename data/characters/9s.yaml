  Free merchant unit focused on support, breaking shields, and dealing magic damage. Second merchant with 4-hit polearm attack (non-ultimate) and second unit with AOE 3-hit shield break ability. Has pathetically low physical attack but high magic attack and speed.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube transcript
usage_strategy: |
  9S is the free unit from the NieR Automata collaboration who functions as a support merchant with shield-breaking capabilities. He has a rare 4-hit polearm attack for shield breaking and AOE 3-hit fire attack that breaks shields regardless. His ultimate shows all weaknesses and provides debuffs. He's more focused on magical damage than physical.

best_use_cases:
  - "Free unit that everyone should obtain through login campaign"
  - "Teams needing shield breaking support with magical damage"
  - "Content requiring lightning and fire coverage"
  - "Players lacking good merchant units"
  - "Situations where weakness revelation is valuable"

weaknesses:
  - "Pathetically low physical attack stat"
  - "Self-destruct ability reduces HP to 1 and can only be used once per battle"
  - "More focused on magical damage than traditional merchant physical damage"
  - "Will be outclassed by future merchants"
  - "Limited to time-limited collaboration"
