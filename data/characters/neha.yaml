role_notes: |
  First general pool unit from Celestia. Skills are kind of all over - wants to do a little bit of everything but main role is heart of elemental team. Enables light/dark/fire/ice elemental attackers to shine with 30% damage cap to those elemental attacks.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube tutorial
usage_strategy: |
  Neha is in same tier as EX Hunted and EX Primrose, perhaps just a tier below. The problem: we have the sauce but no meat - allows elemental teams to shine but don't have outstanding elemental travelers. COTC heavily favors physical attackers, making her obsolete until we get more love for elemental travelers.

best_use_cases:
  - "Elemental teams needing damage cap increases and crit support"
  - "Light/dark/fire/ice elemental attackers synergy"
  - "Teams that can maintain her below 50% SP for passive activation"
  - "Content where elemental damage is primary damage source"

weaknesses:
  - "No outstanding elemental travelers to fully utilize her support"
  - "SP must be below 50% for main passive - requires management headache"
  - "Coming out as 5-star, not 6-star at release"
  - "Physical attackers heavily favored in current meta"

  notes: "Rather useless A4 accessory. Stats all over place, skill is rather useless, and defense buffs are nice but not worth pulling for"
