# Strategic analysis from YouTube transcript
usage_strategy: |
  Krauser is a memory traveler merchant who functions as a physical DPS unit similar to A2. His kit revolves around polearm attacks with unique Ultra Spear mechanics. Ultra Tempest Spear provides 1.5x potency boost to his other spear abilities, while Ultra Stalwart Spear gives 6-hit attacks. These abilities can only be used once per battle unless his ultimate resets them.

best_use_cases:
  - "Polearm-focused teams needing high physical damage output"
  - "Content where enemies are weak to polearms"
  - "Long fights where setup time is available for Ultra Spear activation"
  - "Memory traveler collections for long-term investment"
  - "Players wanting the highest physical attack merchant available"

weaknesses:
  - "Ultra Spear abilities can only be used once or twice per battle"
  - "Limited to polearm and wind coverage - no versatility"
  - "Requires setup turns before reaching maximum damage potential"
  - "Low speed (215) is typical merchant weakness"
  - "Better to save rubies for Rondo who is the better character"
