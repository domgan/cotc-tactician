role_notes: |
  Think of Cyrus version 2.0 - abilities are pretty much the same with added goodies. Has highest elemental attack stat as scholar in entire game (tied with latest JP scholar). Better Cyrus if you missed out on him, but limited by three-hit attacks and lack of enemies weak to all three elements simultaneously.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube tutorial
usage_strategy: |
  Osvald is essentially a better Cyrus but falls off heavily when focusing on specific team comps. His main flaw is that there's only been one relevant boss weak to fire, ice, and lightning all at once (level 120 NPC). He functions more as sub DPS rather than straight elemental DPS since you want to prioritize one or two weaknesses.

best_use_cases:
  - "Teams needing fire, ice, or lightning coverage"
  - "Elemental teams that can utilize his follow-up attack passive"
  - "Content where enemies are weak to multiple elements"
  - "Players who missed Cyrus and need elemental scholar"

weaknesses:
  - "Three-hit attacks aren't great in current meta"
  - "Very few enemies weak to all three elements simultaneously"
  - "Low HP and speed - somewhat squishy"
  - "Elemental attacks still far behind physical attackers"
