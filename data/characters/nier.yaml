# Usage Strategy Notes (from YouTube tutorial)
usage_strategy: |
  OVERVIEW:
  - Merchant with bow, sword, dark weakness coverage
  - Basic skill set but unique EX skill and A4 accessory
  - Functions as support DPS
  - Higher than average physical attack stat for merchant
  
  EX SKILL - MAIN SELLING POINT:
  - Extends enemy break turn by one (one of a kind)
  - Status effect counter decreases by 1 per ally hit
  - When counter reaches zero, extends break turn
  - Must ensure team can capitalize on extra break turn
  - Only traveler in game with this gimmick
  
  KEY ABILITIES:
  - 4-hit AoE sword attack (1 extra hit + 50k damage cap up on broken enemies)
  - 4-hit AoE polearm attack with paralysis chance
  - 2-hit AoE polearm/dark attack with defense down
  - TP skill: 1-6 hit polearm damage (potency varies with BP consumed)
  - 1-hit polearm damage (260 potency) after turn 6
  
  SUPPORT CAPABILITIES:
  - Self dodge to physical attacks (1-4 turns based on boost)
  - 30% sword/polearm damage up (25k damage cap up at 6★)
  - Front row: 15% physical/elemental attack up + 25k damage cap up on break
  - SP recovery (20) + BP recovery (+1) when enemy broken
  
  A4 ACCESSORY - TOP TIER:
  - 200 P.Atk with -30 defenses
  - 15% attack up when enemy broken
  - 10% physical resistance down to all enemies (fantastic for DPS)
  - Doesn't require traveler to be on break duty
  - Possibly one of the best accessories in game (next to Hikari's A4)
  
  SKILL ASSESSMENT:
  - Rather basic merchant skill set
  - 6-hit polearm/dark, 4-hit sword/dark, 2-hit polearm/dark nuke
  - Passive helps with polearm/sword damage up
  - Second passive good for front row support on break
  
  LONGEVITY:
  - Could still see use for EX skill (one of a kind)
  - Future travelers will do significant damage even with shields up
  - Not bad in party merchants but Kainé already out
  - 3/5 longevity rating mainly for EX skill
  
  RECOMMENDATION:
  - EX skill is main selling point (break extender)
  - A4 accessory is top-tier but skills underwhelming
  - Basic as support DPS, second passive is nice
  - 3/5 overall rating
  - F2P: get Kainé first, then consider copy for EX skill
  - Willing to pull for A4 accessory
