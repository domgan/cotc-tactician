# Usage Strategy Notes (from YouTube tutorial)
usage_strategy: |
  SETUP REQUIREMENTS:
  - Takes 4-5 turns to reach full power
  - Requires Cursed Puppet state on 7 allies for full effectiveness
  - Needs BP recovery support and team coordination
  
  ROTATION (SOLO):
  - Turn 1: Purge of Avarice Lv1, move front row to back
  - Turn 2: Purge of Avarice again, activate auto-revives
  - Turn 3: Ultimate technique (passive fully charged)
  - Turn 4: EX skill at max BP
  - Turn 5: Main damage with 100% potency up from EX skill
  - Turn 6+: Use keepers and additional casts
  
  ROTATION (WITH BLACK PRIESTESS):
  - Turn 1: Kill back row
  - Turn 2: Ultimate + kill auto-revive ally
  - Turn 3: EX skill + Black Priestess ultimate
  - Turn 4: Main damage phase
  
  TEAM SYNERGIES:
  - Black Priestess: Provides all elemental exploits, reduces Cursed Puppet requirement
  - Nona: Ultimate gauge increase, 30% potency up EX skill, Penguin Keeper
  - EX Primrose: Ultimate gauge increase, Sheep Keeper
  - Ciso: Tank with auto-revive pack
  - Lucetta: Extends buffs by 1 turn
  
  WEAPON RECOMMENDATION:
  - Brilliant weapon is best in slot (additional 100,000 damage cap up)
  
  COMPARED TO PARTIS:
  - Nearly 2x damage potential
  - Slower setup (4-5 turns vs 3 turns)
  - Better for difficult battles where setup time is justified
