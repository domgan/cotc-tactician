# Strategic analysis from YouTube transcript
usage_strategy: |
  Jillmeila is a dark bow user who excels when enemies are inflicted with bleed. Her 30% damage increase passive when bleeding enemies are present makes her damage output comparable to or even better than Courseus. She has a rare 4-hit dark attack that makes her valuable for dark coverage, but requires setup to reach full potential.

best_use_cases:
  - "Teams that can consistently inflict bleed status"
  - "Content requiring dark elemental coverage"
  - "Situations where high bow damage is needed"
  - "Players lacking other 5-star bow users"

weaknesses:
  - "Requires bleed setup to reach maximum damage potential"
  - "High SP consumption on key abilities (72 SP for Blood Rain)"
  - "Lowest HP among 5-star characters due to passive design"
  - "Selfish kit that doesn't provide team support"
  - "Will be outclassed by future bow users without setup requirements"
