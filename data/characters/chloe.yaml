# Strategic analysis from YouTube transcript
usage_strategy: |
  Chloe is a versatile hunter who does everything well - support, healing, DPS, and bow usage. She has a 3-hit AOE bow attack that increases front row physical attack by 10%, and her ultimate provides top-tier AOE healing plus 20% physical attack, defense, and lightning resistance buffs. She's the only 5-star character with AOE defense up from ultimate.

best_use_cases:
  - "Bow teams needing both damage and support"
  - "Content where healing and buffing in one unit is valuable"
  - "Situations requiring taunt capabilities for protection"
  - "Teams needing bow resistance reduction"
  - "Players wanting a versatile hunter for hunter tower X5"

weaknesses:
  - "Lower physical defense compared to other hunters"
  - "High SP consumption on abilities"
  - "Added to permanent pool so can be skipped for limited units"
  - "Competition with Scarecrow who is better physical DPS"
  - "More of a great all-rounder than specialized"
