# Strategic analysis from YouTube transcript
usage_strategy: |
  Fiore EX is a summer dancer who functions as arguably a good tank. Her abilities allow her to dodge both physical and elemental attacks while countering with fan damage and combustion. She can cover allies from single-target attacks and has combustion status that removes shield points at turn end. She excels in long fights but requires setup to perform well.

best_use_cases:
  - "Major boss fights where tank survival is crucial"
  - "Content requiring shield shaving regardless of weaknesses"
  - "Long fights where her dodge and cover mechanics shine"
  - "Teams needing strong fan damage with tank capabilities"
  - "Situations where anticipating enemy attacks for perfect dodges"

weaknesses:
  - "Requires setup - won't perform well in short fights"
  - "Low SP (286) causes issues with high skill consumption"
  - "Low elemental defense and speed are crucial front row weaknesses"
  - "Limited to fan damage coverage"
  - "Time-limited summer unit availability"
