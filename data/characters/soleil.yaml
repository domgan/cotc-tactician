  Light-based apothecary focused on healing and status effects. Has 3-hit axe and light attacks but primarily serves as support. Provides AOE status ailment removal and dark resistance buffs to front row.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube transcript
usage_strategy: |
  Soleil is a support-focused apothecary with light element coverage. While she has 3-hit axe and light attacks, her main value comes from AOE status ailment removal and 20% dark resistance buff for front row. Her healing capabilities are inferior to dedicated healers like Ophilia or Millard, making her more of a niche support character.

best_use_cases:
  - "Content requiring AOE status ailment removal"
  - "Situations with high dark damage that need resistance buffs"
  - "Teams needing light/axe coverage with some healing"
  - "Players lacking other apothecaries"

weaknesses:
  - "Mediocre stats with weakest physical attack among 5-star apothecaries"
  - "Healing capabilities inferior to dedicated healers"
  - "Most abilities have limited current usage in game meta"
  - "Outclassed by other apothecaries for most content"
  - "Role is too scattered between healing, damage, and support"
