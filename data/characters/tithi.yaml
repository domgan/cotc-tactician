role_notes: |
  Arguably one of the best supports in the game, rivaling Lynette. Can reach 30% cap for physical attack and magical attack debuffs for all enemies, and 30% cap for physical attack and magical attack buffs for front row. BP goddess who can cap buffs/debuffs in just two turns.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube transcript
usage_strategy: |
  Tithi is an exceptional dancer support who functions as a BP goddess. Her abilities are counted as two separate abilities at normal and Max BP usage, allowing her to cap front row physical/magical attack and crit rate at 30% in just two turns, or debuff enemy physical/magical attack to 30% in two turns. She revolves around BP recovery and giving BP to allies.

best_use_cases:
  - "Teams needing rapid buff capping for physical and magical attack"
  - "Content requiring enemy debuff capping"
  - "Situations where BP generation and distribution is crucial"
  - "Teams that can benefit from lightning resistance reduction"
  - "Players wanting a top-tier buffer rivaling Lynette"

weaknesses:
  - "Dancers are naturally squishy with lowest physical defense"
  - "Limited to time-limited sacred blaze guidance banner"
  - "Not a necessary unit like Therion or Ophelia"
  - "More of a want unit than essential"
  - "Fan users not capable of high physical DPS damage"
