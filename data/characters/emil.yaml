# Usage Strategy Notes (from YouTube tutorial)
usage_strategy: |
  OVERVIEW:
  - Dark cleric and current best dark elemental attacker in game
  - True definition of dark elemental traveler
  - Great for taking out enemies weak to dark and tome
  - Pairs very well with EX Thel for dark weakness implantation
  - Limited to dark/tome weaknesses which aren't too common
  
  KEY ABILITIES:
  - 3-hit random target dark attacks (lowers dark resist 15% per hit)
  - 3-hit random target dark (2-5 turn duration based on boost)
  - 1-9 hit single target dark (consumes 20 SP per hit, up to 180 SP total)
  - 3-hit AoE dark (consumes 15 SP to recast)
  - 1-hit single target dark (consumes 15 SP to recast)
  - EX skill: 1-hit single target (530 potency, consumes 200 SP to recast)
  
  BREAKING CAPABILITIES:
  - 9-hit tome/dark attack makes him one of the best dark/tome breakers
  - Costs 180 SP total for maximum hits
  - 6-hit AoE always available
  - 2-hit nuke attack with 530 potency
  
  SUPPORT CAPABILITIES:
  - Front row: 15% physical/elemental defense up + 30% damage reduction (1 time)
  - Front row: 20% physical/elemental attack up + 20% polearm/dagger/dark up
  - Ultimate: Full SP restore + 10k-50k damage cap up
  
  PASSIVES:
  - 30% dark damage up + 30% crit up + can crit with elemental attacks (6★)
  - 10 SP regen
  - 50% cap to attack from active and passive buffs
  - TP passive extends cap to 50% for active/passive buffs
  
  A4 ACCESSORY:
  - 200 E.Atk with -32 defenses
  - 10 SP regen + 10% max SP restore when under 50% SP
  - Passive is rather useless with Shaana and EX Renu available
  - Wouldn't chase after it, prioritize Kainé first
  
  LONGEVITY:
  - Here to stay with EX Thel now existing to implant dark weakness
  - Decent future as dark elemental attacker
  - 3.75/5 longevity rating
  
  RECOMMENDATION:
  - Solid dark elemental DPS with everything a DPS should have
  - Great breaking skills, debuffs, nuke attack, 50% buff cap
  - Only missing innate potency up like Kainé's
  - 3.8/5 overall rating
  - Pull to A1 then stop, prioritize Kainé > NieR > Emil
