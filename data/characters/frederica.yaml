roles: ["breaker", "dps"]
role_notes: |
  For six stars, her TP passive gives her access to double casting upon breaking an enemy, similar to Oshad. This somewhat turns her into a breaker role, but she is still only limited to fire elemental attacks. Has strong fire damage output with combustion mechanics and decent breaking capabilities for fire-weak enemies.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube tutorial
usage_strategy: |
  Frederica is severely limited to only enemies weak to fire. Her TP skill does help with shaving shields as it's a five-hitter to fire and inflicts combustion, but the fire limitation is significant. For free-to-play players, it's possibly worth skipping on her unless you specifically need fire coverage and breaking.

best_use_cases:
  - "Teams needing fire elemental breaker capabilities"
  - "Content where enemies are weak to fire"
  - "Players lacking dedicated fire breakers"
  - "Teams that can utilize combustion mechanics"

weaknesses:
  - "Severely limited to only fire elemental attacks"
  - "Limited usefulness against non-fire-weak enemies"
  - "A4 accessory is more nice-to-have than essential"
  - "Competition from other fire users in the meta"
