  Dark thief with access to multi-hit attacks with daggers, tomes, and dark. Has unique "unbridled passion" passive that activates when allies die or ultimate is used, changing his abilities and providing 30% damage boosts. A4 accessory allows any character to start battle with full ultimate bar.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube transcript
usage_strategy: |
  Auguste is a dark thief whose main selling point is his interesting passive mechanic. When allies die or he uses his ultimate, he becomes "impassioned" for 4 turns, gaining 30% physical and dark attack boosts, and his abilities change - some become guaranteed crits and recover 3 BP. He has forehead attacks for all three elements and can lower dagger resistance.

best_use_cases:
  - "Dark teams needing versatile coverage with dagger, tome, and dark"
  - "Situations where his A4 accessory's full ultimate bar is game-changing"
  - "Teams that can benefit from his passive activation in longer fights"
  - "Content requiring dagger resistance reduction"
  - "Players who have A2 or Velco and want additional dark coverage"

weaknesses:
  - "Doesn't have any abilities that break shields regardless of weaknesses"
  - "Limited to dagger, tome, and dark attacks for shield breaking"
  - "Passive requires setup - unlikely to activate in short fights"
  - "As limited time unit, expected more capabilities"
  - "Will be outclassed by future thieves coming to the game"
