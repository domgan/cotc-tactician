# Strategic analysis from YouTube transcript
usage_strategy: |
  W'ludai is an exceptional dark merchant who finally addresses the speed issues of merchants. She has the highest physical attack stat and speed among merchants, outspeeding others by 60-100 points. She's the only merchant with a 4-hit polearm attack and has access to rare 3-hit dark magic attacks with blindness. Her 5-8 hit ultimate is the ultimate tool for breaking polearm weaknesses.

best_use_cases:
  - "Teams needing fast polearm breaking capabilities"
  - "Content requiring dark elemental coverage"
  - "Pairs well with Dorothea for high damage output"
  - "Situations where blindness status is useful"
  - "Fast-paced content where merchant speed matters"

weaknesses:
  - "Suffers in SP, defense, and magic defense stats"
  - "Time-limited availability initially"
  - "Requires specific team composition to maximize potential"
  - "High SP consumption on multi-hit abilities"
  - "Will eventually be added to permanent pool"
