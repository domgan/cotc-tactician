# Strategic analysis from YouTube transcript
usage_strategy: |
  Sofia EX is a summer apothecary focused on wind damage with unique Marine Wisdom mechanics. Her abilities change and become more powerful when she accumulates buffs - Marine Wisdom I at 8 buffs gives SP/BP recovery, while Marine Wisdom II at 16 buffs provides 1.5x damage modifiers and guaranteed critical hits. She has healing capabilities but requires setup to reach full potential.

best_use_cases:
  - "Wind-focused teams needing high damage output with healing backup"
  - "Content where her massive SP pool provides sustainability"
  - "Teams that can help her stack buffs quickly for Marine Wisdom activation"
  - "Situations requiring both wind damage and healing in one unit"
  - "Players who want an alternative to Odette for wind coverage"

weaknesses:
  - "Limited to only wind damage - no multi-axe attacks"
  - "Requires setup time to stack buffs for Marine Wisdom activation"
  - "Passive becomes useless against buff-dispelling enemies like Yan Long"
  - "Physical defense is on lower side for front row positioning"
  - "Wind is already covered by many characters in current meta"
