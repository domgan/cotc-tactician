# Usage Strategy Notes (from YouTube tutorial)
usage_strategy: |
  OVERVIEW:
  - EX dancer focused on fan damage and all elements exploitation
  - Highest physical attack among dancers (485 at Lv120)
  - Incredibly slow speed (387 at Lv120) unlike most dancers
  - Main character when it comes to fan weaknesses
  - Luxury/nice-to-have traveler, not essential
  
  KEY ABILITIES:
  - 3-hit AoE fan (65 potency, 15% fan resist down)
  - 4-hit single target fan (65 potency)
  - 2-hit single target fan (45-55 potency, consumes 100 SP from each ally for 5x potency up to 1200)
  - 5-hit random target fan (35 potency, 15% fan resist down per hit)
  - EX skill: 1-hit single target fan (65 potency, consumes 100 SP from each ally, 9 hits max)
  
  ULTIMATE:
  - Goes first, gives all allies 5-10% phys/ele attack up (2-3 turns)
  - 100% potency up to dancer skills for 1 turn
  - Essentially AoE Solon ultimate but only for dancers
  
  DANCER SQUAD MECHANICS:
  - 2 dancers: 15% phys/ele attack up
  - 3+ dancers: 30% fan damage up
  - 4+ dancers: 3% SP regen
  - 6 dancers: 50% HP regen
  - Follow-up attack: 4-8 hits based on dancer count (4 dancers = 4 hits, 6 dancers = 8 hits)
  
  LANE SKILL:
  - Wait 2 turns, reuse after 6 turns
  - Exploits all elemental weaknesses with fan damage
  - Combined with EX skill: 17 hits to fan + all elements
  
  BREAKING CAPABILITIES:
  - Maximum 17 hits with full dancer party + lane skill + EX skill
  - Requires dancer-only team for maximum effectiveness
  - Meta for physical fan damage isn't great currently
  
  A4 ACCESSORY:
  - 80 P.Atk + 60 SP + 100k damage cap up
  - 20% fan resist down when front row breaks enemy
  - 100k damage cap up is best aspect
  - Fan resist down is somewhat useless
  - Would be better with higher physical attack or defense down passive
  
  LONGEVITY:
  - Could see use if COTC adds more fan weakness specialists
  - Entering new meta with daggers and swords
  - Might be benched until fan meta returns
  - 3.25/5 longevity rating
  
  RECOMMENDATION:
  - Luxury unit, not must-have
  - Requires full dancer team for maximum effectiveness
  - Most travelers won't benefit from dancer-only ultimate
  - Fun unit but not great investment
  - 3.25/5 overall rating
  
  PULL STRATEGY:
  - Summer traveler on separate banner
  - More fun than needed unit
  - If he was warrior with these skills, would be amazing
  - Limited reruns until summer season returns
  
  COMPARISON:
  - Better than OG Tatloch who was previously buffed
  - Even with buffs, not enough for fan users to nominally shine
  - 0.5/5 time limited (summer traveler)
  - 4.5/5 design
  - 5/5 VA (Gaito Ishiawa)
