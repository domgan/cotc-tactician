role_notes: |
  Newest traveler with 6-star buffs. Mainly deals polearm attacks with other abilities hitting bow weaknesses. Has big nuke attack and latent ability (only original Octopath 2 travelers get this). Strongest merchant currently but will be outshined by future merchants.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube tutorial
usage_strategy: |
  Partitio was given strong nuke attack similar to Titus's 6-star EX skill. First character released after major system changes so he's stronger compared to other travelers. Bow abilities will never be used as kit is mainly suited for polearm users. Latent ability is nice but restricted to only merchants.

best_use_cases:
  - "Polearm weakness coverage with strong nuke potential"
  - "Teams needing BP restoration and support"
  - "Merchant-focused team compositions"
  - "Players wanting strongest current merchant"

weaknesses:
  - "Will be outshined by future merchants"
  - "Bow abilities never used - polearm focused kit"
  - "EX ability locked behind waiting 3 turns"
  - "Ultimate not worth leveling to 10 if you have EX Agnea"
