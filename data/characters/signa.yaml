role_notes: |
  The best debuffer in the entire game including up to JP. Has four different kinds of debuffs that all stack and is a decent breaker for fan, light, and fire. Access to passive debuffs, active debuffs, countdown ability, and ultimate debuff.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube tutorial
usage_strategy: |
  Signa is the prize of the two warriors coming with Cantos. Warriors will always be getting better as COTC loves warriors, but debuffers are a commodity. She has access to passive debuffs with her passive skill, active debuffs with attacking skills, four-turn countdown for resistance debuffs, and ultimate debuff.

best_use_cases:
  - "Any battle requiring comprehensive debuffing"
  - "Fan weakness breaking with up to 6-hit attacks"
  - "Light and fire weakness breaking with AOE 6-hit attacks"
  - "Teams needing sword, fire, and light resistance reduction"

weaknesses:
  - "Extremely squishy with only 2600 HP and 255 defense"
  - "Requires decent accessories to survive"
  - "Limited to fan, light, and fire damage types"
  - "Relies on status effects for maximum effectiveness"
