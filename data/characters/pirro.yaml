role_notes: |
  The better Thief counterpart to Thron. Skills are all about dealing damage with potential double cast from passives. Physical attack stat way above Thron (509 at level 120) allowing massive damage with crazy potencies. Has 50% chance to reactivate skills for one turn.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube tutorial
usage_strategy: |
  Pirro is the better Thron - everything Thron does he does better except inflicting miss physical attack debuff. His 50% passive allows double casting abilities and can shave up to 10 shields at any time. While better than Thron, still miles away from upcoming overpowered thieves.

best_use_cases:
  - "Dagger and dark weakness coverage"
  - "Teams needing high single-target damage"
  - "Shield breaking with multi-hit attacks"
  - "Players who missed Thron and want thief upgrade"

weaknesses:
  - "Permanent 15% speed down from passive"
  - "High SP consumption for high potency skills"
  - "Will be power crept by upcoming stronger thieves"
  - "Limited to dagger and dark damage types"
