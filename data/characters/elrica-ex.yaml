# Usage Strategy Notes (from YouTube tutorial)
usage_strategy: |
  OVERVIEW:
  - Back-row shield breaker with all physical weakness exploitation
  - "Better Sarisa" but struggles to justify usage with dedicated breakers
  - Received global buffs but kit was overall worse than EX Ditraina
  
  KEY ABILITIES:
  - Random target attacks: Break dagger/lightning weaknesses
  - Back-row passive: +1 dagger attack to allies, reduces shields
  - Third passive: All physical weakness exploitation when enemy broken
  - Can break 2 shields per turn from back row after activation
  - Can break 5 shields at max boost
  
  USAGE STRATEGY:
  - Operates from back row for support benefits
  - SP regen and damage reduction for front row
  - Follow-up dagger attacks when front row allies attack
  - Best as offset shield breaker
  
  COMPARISONS:
  vs Sarisa:
  - Better version with more utility
  - Still very much a "glorified Sarisa"
  
  vs Kainé/Tiziano:
  - Not needed if you have this combo
  - Competes for dagger weakness counters that Kainé needs
  - Better to bring another support
  
  vs Dedicated Breakers (Sarisa/others):
  - Difficult to justify if you already have dedicated breaker
  - General all-around breakers fall off to power creep
  
  A4 ACCESSORY:
  - 60 P.Atk, 80 Crit, 20k damage cap up for front row
  - 10% dagger resist down
  - Not worth it if you already have Hikari's or Neith's A4
  - Skip unless specifically need dagger resist down
  
  LONGEVITY:
  - General breakers good for new players but fall off quickly
  - Power creep will make her less relevant
  - 2.75/5 longevity rating
  
  RECOMMENDATION:
  - Skip for most players
  - Continue saving rubies for travelers who truly matter
  - 2.75/5 overall rating
  - Nice to have waifu but not must-have
