role_notes: |
  Fire and Light Warrior from the big three in Orsterra (him, Orlick, Alia). Still being used by JP players as one of the best fire attacking travelers. Has blade master passive that enhances boost level by one and blazing spirit that restores BP when breaking enemies.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube tutorial
usage_strategy: |
  Sazantos is the top three warriors to pull for on the Orsterra side. Currently we don't have a notable traveler for fire weakness - Cantos does this well with sore damage capability. In terms of usability and breaking multiple enemies, Sazantos is above Alia, but for single target damage Alia has upper hand with 10 hits.

best_use_cases:
  - "Fire weakness coverage with high damage output"
  - "Teams needing BP restoration and support"
  - "Breaking multiple enemies with AOE attacks"
  - "Content requiring fire and light damage"

weaknesses:
  - "Low speed compared to other attackers"
  - "Alia outclasses him for single target damage (10 hits vs 8)"
  - "Requires BP management for maximum effectiveness"
  - "Limited to fire and light damage types"
