role_notes: |
  One of the top five strongest polearm users in the game, even still in JP. Second strongest merchant in terms of attack stat (just below future collaboration merchant). Start of the polearm meta until real broken travelers come out. First traveler to get innate 100% potency up added to skill set.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube tutorial
usage_strategy: |
  Magnolia is essentially the start of the polearm meta. Her gimmick gives her added effects with speed down, and if you have Sigma, those effects will always proc. She's extremely self-sufficient with 100% potency up when consuming 3+ BP, but somewhat selfish as she doesn't offer noteworthy team support.

best_use_cases:
  - "Polearm-focused teams needing strong DPS"
  - "Teams with Sigma for guaranteed speed down procs"
  - "Content where polearm weakness coverage is essential"
  - "Players looking to upgrade merchant squad"

weaknesses:
  - "Can't hit lightning weaknesses with polearm abilities"
  - "Selfish character - doesn't offer team support"
  - "Low speed (275 at six stars)"
  - "Will be replaced by future broken travelers"
