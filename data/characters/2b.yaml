# Strategic analysis from YouTube transcript
usage_strategy: |
  2B is the "best waifu" warrior from the NieR Automata collaboration with access to both sword and axe abilities. She has the highest physical attack and speed among warriors, making her the current strongest warrior. Her versatility comes from covering both weapon types with 3-hit attacks, but she's limited by skill usage requiring adjustment based on enemy weaknesses.

best_use_cases:
  - "Content requiring sword and axe coverage"
  - "Situations where high physical damage is needed"
  - "Teams needing versatile warrior coverage"
  - "Players wanting the strongest current warrior"
  - "Content where guaranteed critical hits are valuable"

weaknesses:
  - "Warrior class is oversaturated with better units coming in future"
  - "Limited by skill usage requiring enemy weakness adjustment"
  - "Will be outclassed by future warriors as Square Enix loves sword users"
  - "Time-limited collaboration availability"
  - "Suffers from having too many great abilities that can't all be used"
