# Roles - [HUMAN-REQUIRED] Must be assigned manually based on skills
roles: ["tank"]
role_notes: |
  Tank warrior and honestly that's all she does. If you have Orlick, she's just the female version of him. Gains Indomitable Points when enemies hit her, which provide various buffs and potency increases based on points accumulated. Has auto-provoke at battle start at six stars.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube tutorial
usage_strategy: |
  This is a hard no - you're better off using free warriors like Orad and Serenoa who are much more useful and provide more for your team. She's joining the general pool and there's no need for another warrior tank like Orlick. Day you pull her is probably the day you'll bench her.

best_use_cases:
  - "Players who specifically want female version of Orlick"
  - "Teams needing provoke tank with no other options"
  - "Content where physical defense stacking is valuable"

weaknesses:
  - "Far power crept even when compared to older travelers"
  - "Better options exist (Orad, Serenoa) as free warriors"
  - "General pool unit - not worth pulling for"
  - "Limited to tank role with no additional utility"
