role_notes: |
  Definitely the best hunter as of right now but will get outclassed soon. Has many abilities allowing different attack types (polearm, axe, wind, lightning, light) but doesn't do well getting those weaknesses other than bow. Got buffed compared to JP side. Double cast passive when breaking enemies for 2 turns.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube tutorial
usage_strategy: |
  Ochette is in same boat as Partio - best hunter currently but will be outclassed. Her buffs are nice but more like sprinkles on top. Double cast passive only lasts 2 turns and she becomes designated enemy breaker, meaning you need to equip her with accessories that give enemy debuffs upon breaks. Six-hit random target bow attack is highest guaranteed bow attacks we've seen.

best_use_cases:
  - "Bow weakness breaking with high hit counts"
  - "Teams needing Leghold Trap to delay enemy turns"
  - "Bow-only compositions where she shines"
  - "New players who need good hunter early on"

weaknesses:
  - "Limited to bow attacks for main effectiveness"
  - "Will be outclassed by future hunters (like Agnea with 6-star awakening)"
  - "Animal companion abilities (Akala/Mahina) rather useless for experienced players"
  - "Ultimate is only 5-hit AOE bow attack - no better than normal skill"
