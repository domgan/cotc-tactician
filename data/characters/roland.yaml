role_notes: |
  Possibly the better character of the Triangle Strategy trio. Main role is inflicting passive polearm resist down - was previously buffed in global version. Still a traveler worth bringing in polearm squads. Global buffs made him the ultimate passive polearm resist down traveler in game. Can cap out polearm resist to 30% using two different skills plus second passive procs. Ultimate gives 15% to 20% polearm resist down that stacks with other debuffs.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube tutorial
usage_strategy: |
  Roland is a decent traveler for enemies weak to polearms. His main value comes from being one of the few travelers that can lower polearm resist down as his ultimate, and this ultimate debuff stacks with other debuffs in the game. For free-to-play players, he's worth considering if you need polearm support. For those who spend a little, getting one copy to ultimate level 10 is valuable.

best_use_cases:
  - "Polearm-focused teams needing resistance down debuffs"
  - "Teams that can stack multiple resistance down effects"
  - "Content where polearm weakness coverage is needed"
  - "Players lacking dedicated polearm debuffers"

weaknesses:
  - "Limited to polearm damage type"
  - "Accessory will get replaced as more travelers get passive equipment buffs"
  - "Not essential if you already have good polearm users"
  - "Rerun character - can skip if you have adequate polearm support"
