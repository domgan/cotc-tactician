# Usage Strategy Notes (from YouTube tutorial)
usage_strategy: |
  OVERVIEW:
  - The glove to Kainé or Kainé enabler
  - Makes daggers great again with passives, ultimate, and TP skills
  - Functions as sub-DPS or dagger enabler
  - Top 5 speed among thieves (525 at Lv120)
  - Essential for Kainé users to make all enemies weak to daggers
  
  KEY ABILITIES:
  - 2-hit single target dagger (lowers shield points regardless)
  - 5-hit AoE dagger (exploits wind, 25 potency)
  - 2-hit single target dagger (135-150 potency, inflicts dagger weakening)
  - TP skill: 1-hit dagger (260 potency, inflicts 3-6 dagger weakness)
  - EX skill: 20% physical attack up + 20% crit damage up + dead aim for thieves
  
  ULTIMATE:
  - AoE 5-10% dagger resist down (2-3 turns, becomes 3 at level 10)
  - Front row 5-10% dagger damage up
  - Dead aim for 2-3 turns
  - Combination of Sonia's and Falos ultimates
  - Get to level 10 before anything else
  
  PASSIVES - DAGGER SQUAD FOCUSED:
  - Front row break: 15% dagger resist down for 2 turns
  - Thief squad buffs: 2+ thieves = 15% dagger damage up
  - 3+ thieves = 15% physical attack + crit up
  - 4+ thieves = crit damage multiplier 1.25→1.4
  - Front row: 30,000 damage cap up
  
  KAINÉ SYNERGY:
  - Passive 15% dagger resist down + Canari's A4 = capped 30% resist down + 10% defense down
  - 4+ thieves increases crit damage to 1.4x (no caps for this category)
  - Helps Kainé hit damage cap much more easily
  - 30k damage cap up addresses Kainé's main drawback
  
  A4 ACCESSORY:
  - 50 P.Atk, 40 speed, 50 SP
  - Break: 10% dagger resist down + 3 dagger weakness implants
  - Lower tier - flat stats aren't great
  - Canari's A4 better (15% resist down + 10% defense down)
  - Leave at ultimate level 10, don't chase A4
  
  LONGEVITY:
  - Future travelers will give allies special buffs to hit multiple weaknesses
  - This will slowly make Tiziano less relevant
  - But 4+ thieves passive may still be useful
  - Currently ultimate dagger enabler
  - 3.5/5 longevity rating
  
  RECOMMENDATION:
  - If you have Kainé, you should pull for Tiziano
  - If you don't have Kainé, perhaps skip
  - Currently in weakness implant meta - Tiziano + Kainé is the name
  - 3.5/5 overall rating
  - Get to ultimate level 10 and stop
  
  PRIORITY:
  - Kainé > Tiziano for dagger meta
  - Physical attacks still the way to go
  - Kainé still broken and top priority
