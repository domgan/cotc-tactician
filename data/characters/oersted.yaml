  Wind warrior from Live A Live collaboration, free traveler for everyone. Able to hit multiple weaknesses with damage that increases in battle as passive raises potency. Has 4-hit AOE sword attack and Valor point buildup system.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube tutorial
usage_strategy: |
  Oersted is absolutely amazing for new players and free-to-play - will carry them far through story. Outshines all warriors up until Richard and Rondo. Has 4-hit AOE sword attack with high SP cost but amazing for teams against multiple enemies weak to sword.

best_use_cases:
  - "New player progression and story clearing"
  - "Sword weakness breaking with 4-hit AOE attacks"
  - "Teams needing multi-weakness coverage"
  - "Free-to-play players lacking good warriors"

weaknesses:
  - "Requires 9 turns to reach maximum 45% potency boost"
  - "Single-hit attacks for staff/polearm make breaking difficult"
  - "Gets outshined quickly by players with most warriors"
  - "Low speed (270) means acts at end of turn order"
