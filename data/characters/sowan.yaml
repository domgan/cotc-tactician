# Usage Strategy Notes (from YouTube tutorial)
usage_strategy: |
  OVERVIEW:
  - Light and dark apothecary with daybreak/nightfall mechanic
  - Good axe DPS support but global buffs weren't enough
  - Functions mainly as sub-DPS with healing capabilities
  - Opens the way for axe travelers but lacks notable bossers
  - Not much love for DPS apothecaries besides Castti and Nefty
  
  DAYBREAK/NIGHTFALL MECHANIC:
  - Similar to Temenos's infinite light/infinite dark passives
  - Daybreak: Recasts skills, SP restore, additional effects
  - Nightfall: 40% potency up, additional effects
  - Both active: Enhanced effects (7-hit attacks, damage cap up, etc.)
  - Passives are not permanent (unlike Temenos)
  - Pain to maintain turn duration
  
  KEY ABILITIES:
  - Duskbreaker: 4-hit random axe attack (7-hit with both buffs)
  - Twofold Dawn Gash: 2-hit single target (recast + potency up)
  - Dawnbreaker: 2-hit AoE with defense down (enhanced with buffs)
  - Lane Power: Choose between 3-hit AoE + nightfall or front row buffs + daybreak
  - EX skill: 4-hit AoE with additional effects when buffs active
  
  ULTIMATE:
  - AoE HP restore (200-300 potency) + 10% SP restore
  - Restores 1 BP + cures status ailments + immunity
  - Daybreak: Revives allies 25% HP
  - Nightfall: 5-10% axe damage up
  
  SUPPORT CAPABILITIES:
  - Front row: 15% attack/axe damage up + 20k damage cap up
  - Daybreak: 30% SP restore to front row
  - Nightfall: 50% passive/active axe cap up
  - Both: 50% active axe damage cap up
  - HP restoration and status ailment curing
  
  A4 ACCESSORY:
  - 50 P.Atk, 90 crit, 15% crit up, 20% max damage
  - Apothecary: 1.4x crit damage multiplier
  - Disgustingly low attack stat, crit rate is waste of time
  - Straight up garbage
  
  LONGEVITY:
  - Might have use with future strong axe path carrier
  - But other stronger travelers will also come
  - Not much love for axe users currently
  - Everyone has Kainé or at least Kainé
  
  RECOMMENDATION:
  - Skip unless absolutely diehard axe fanatic
  - Save rubies for other notable strong DPS travelers
  - Sword meta returning soon
  - 2.75/5 overall rating
  - Global buffs were good but not enough
