# Roles - [HUMAN-REQUIRED] Must be assigned manually based on skills
roles: ["healer", "buffer"]
role_notes: |
  Rather underwhelming cleric - almost all skills are things we've seen before, doesn't bring much new to table. Little bit better compared to current supports and healers. Passive gives HP barrier when restoring HP at max HP, and TP passive gives 30% damage reduction after using attack skill.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube tutorial
usage_strategy: |
  Gloria is lacking in many areas for future standards. There's going to be a future Apothecary that will replace Renu, EX Lani, and even Gloria. If you currently have Renu, EX Primrose, or Agnea, you don't need to pull for Gloria. Her abilities are nice to have but nothing gamebreaking.

best_use_cases:
  - "Teams needing ice and light elemental coverage"
  - "Players without dedicated healer/support characters"
  - "Content requiring HP barriers and damage reduction"
  - "Teams that can utilize her elemental attack buffs"

weaknesses:
  - "Underwhelming skills - nothing new to table"
  - "Will be replaced by future Apothecary"
  - "HP barrier passive requires ally at max HP (defeats purpose)"
  - "TP skill has 3-turn delay - timing issues"

# A4 Accessory - parsed from YouTube transcript

  passive_effect: "80 Elemental Attack, 60 SP; Start of battle: Grant Entire Front Row HP barrier (25% user's max HP); At full HP: Extend duration of augmenting effects granted by Self by 1 turn"
  notes: "Nice especially the buff extension, but as collaboration traveler not worth chasing. Collab units don't get Awakening Stones in exchange tab. Better to chase Juum's or EX Primrose's A4 accessories"
