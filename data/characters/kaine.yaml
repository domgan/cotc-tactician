  First new generation DPS traveler and current best DPS in game. Has highest physical attack stat (573 at Lv120).

# Usage Strategy Notes (from YouTube tutorial)
usage_strategy: |
  OVERVIEW:
  - Light thief from NieR collaboration, first new generation DPS traveler
  - Current best DPS in game with highest physical attack stat (573 at Lv120)
  - Perfect candidate for what we want in DPS traveler
  - Start of new meta and baseline for top-tier DPS expectations
  - Incredibly low speed (395), acts towards end of action order
  
  KEY MECHANICS:
  - Innate 50% active and passive buff cap (30% normal)
  - 120% potency up when consuming 3+ BP (100% at 6★)
  - 100k damage cap up when consuming 5 BP
  - Fighting Spirit buff from ultimate allows BP usage without consumption
  
  KEY ABILITIES:
  - 3-hit AoE dagger (20% attack up for 2-5 turns at 3+ BP, 5 turns at 5+ BP)
  - 3-8 hit single target dagger/light (potency varies by BP)
  - 5-hit random target dagger (20% resist down per hit)
  - 2-hit single target dagger (guaranteed crit at 3+ BP, 50k cap up at 5+ BP)
  - EX skill: 8-hit random target (guaranteed crit at 3+ BP, 10 hits at 5+ BP)
  
  SUPPORT CAPABILITIES:
  - Taunt skill: Provoke all enemies + counter physical/elemental attacks
  - Counter attack: 1-hit dagger/light (180 potency) + recovers 1 BP
  - TP skill: 50% physical attack up + 1 BP recovery (3-8 turns)
  - Ultimate: 10-15% physical attack up + Fighting Spirit (free BP usage)
  
  BUILDING OPTIMAL DAMAGE:
  - Six categories for damage: active buffs/debuffs, passive buffs/debuffs, ultimate buffs/debuffs, keepers
  - Each category capped at 30% except keepers
  - Kainé unique: 50% passive attack buff cap (vs 30% normal)
  - Want to cap: passive attack (50%), dagger damage (30%), debuffs (30%)
  - Keepers: Chomper (30% damage up) + Mealis (20% physical attack up)
  
  WEAPON RECOMMENDATIONS:
  - Fortune weapons for multi-hitting attacks (early/mid game)
  - Stalwart/Brilliant weapons for damage cap up (hits cap easily)
  - Celestia: build whatever Um weapon available
  
  ACCESSORY RECOMMENDATIONS:
  - Kainé's A4: 200 P.Atk + 30% attack up at 3+ BP + ultimate gauge 100%
  - Free Tony accessory: 200 attack + 100k damage cap up
  - Ritu's A4: 15% dagger damage up (capping passive dagger damage)
  - Kota's right hand: 30% attack up (3 turns at battle start)
  
  TEAM BUILDING EXAMPLE (F2P):
  Front: Kainé (A4) + Fulco (passive dagger attack up) + EX Primrose (buffs/heals)
  Back: Lucetta (extend buffs) + EX Hunet (debuffs) + Saresa (breaker) + Billy (ultimate debuffs) + Lynette (buffs)
  
  A4 ACCESSORY:
  - 200 P.Atk with -30 defenses
  - Ultimate gauge 100% at battle start
  - 30% physical attack up when consuming 3+ BP
  - Good but not as good as NieR's
  - Premium accessory (collaboration travelers lack awakening stones in exchange)
  
  LONGEVITY:
  - Still used in JP server despite power creep
  - So strong developers gave bosses immunity to weakness implants
  - F2P Kainé at awakening 0 still does crazy damage
  - Needs Tiziano to enable dagger weaknesses on non-dagger enemies
  - 4/5 longevity rating
  
  RECOMMENDATION:
  - Pull if you like what she brings, but consider Tiziano too
  - Future DPS travelers will only get stronger
  - Don't constantly wait for next DPS traveler
  - 4.5/5 abilities rating, 10/5 design
  - Current best DPS, baseline for top-tier expectations
  
  PULL STRATEGY:
  - Prioritize A1 first (functions as straight DPS)
  - Ultimate to level 10 if possible for Fighting Spirit
  - Don't put yourself in sticky situation, but great character
  - "I just really like girls" - wise words for pulling decisions
