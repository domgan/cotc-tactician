role_notes: |
  Probably the best of the three Champions. Light hunter with access to forehead attacks for bows, fans, and light. Second strongest bow user (only 5 points away from Scarecrow) but faster. Ideal candidate for finding enemy weaknesses with 4-hit attacks.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube transcript
usage_strategy: |
  Herminia is a versatile hunter who can cover bow, fan, and light elements with forehead attacks for each. She has a 30% chance to summon NPCs that inflict bleeding when using damage abilities. Her role is concrete as a breaker - any character that can cover three attack types with 4 hits is amazing for finding weaknesses.

best_use_cases:
  - "Teams needing versatile breaker with multiple element coverage"
  - "Content where finding enemy weaknesses quickly is crucial"
  - "Bow-focused teams needing additional coverage"
  - "Parties with characters that benefit from bleed effects like Jillmeila and Hayes"
  - "Situations requiring light, fan, and bow coverage in one unit"

weaknesses:
  - "Not going to do massive damage compared to dedicated DPS"
  - "Limited to breaker role rather than primary damage dealer"
  - "Will eventually be replaced by other Travelers"
  - "Time-limited availability from Memoirs"
  - "More of a utility breaker than damage powerhouse"
