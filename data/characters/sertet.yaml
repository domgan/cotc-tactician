role_notes: |
  Wind hunter introducing new status element Erosion (same as combustion - enemy takes damage then loses one shield). Also introduces physical resistance down status effect. Can stack with combustion users to shave off two shields per turn.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube tutorial
usage_strategy: |
  Sertet is a safe skip - joining general pool after banner so not worth pulling. Main selling point is physical resistance down but does terrible job maintaining it. Must apply corrosion first, then use ability that applies physical resistance down which removes corrosion - biggest flaw.

best_use_cases:
  - "Hunter-only squads needing bow damage"
  - "Teams with other combustion users for shield shaving"
  - "Content where bow and wind weaknesses are present"
  - "Players needing corrosion status infliction"

weaknesses:
  - "Cannot maintain physical resistance down for long duration"
  - "Must reapply corrosion after using physical resistance down ability"
  - "Massive nuke attack has 300 SP cost and doesn't hit wind weakness"
  - "Game caters to multi-weakness characters, she's limited to bow/wind"
