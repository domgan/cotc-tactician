role_notes: |
  Dark warrior embodying Dark Knight features - deals damage to self/allies to inflict massive damage. Has 5-6 hit ability at all times and possible 8-hit AOE attack. Savior for dark weakness coverage. Still widely used on JP side.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube tutorial
usage_strategy: |
  O. Odio is good and will be best warrior for a while. Can keep allies HP up and potentially use AOE sword/dark attack every 2 turns. Support skill as warrior is amazing - front row takes 50% max HP damage but gets 20% damage up and dead aim. Straightforward to use.

best_use_cases:
  - "Dark weakness coverage with high hit counts"
  - "Teams that can maintain HP above 60% for his abilities"
  - "Content requiring massive dark damage output"
  - "Players needing best current dark warrior"

weaknesses:
  - "Must keep allies HP above 60% to avoid damaging them"
  - "Requires careful turn order - want him to act last"
  - "Alia has advantage in usefulness (can also hit light weakness)"
  - "Self-damaging abilities require HP management"
