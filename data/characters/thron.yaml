role_notes: |
  Great chill breaker for enemies weak to daggers. Introduces new status element Miss Physical Attack. Second least used character from original eight Octopath 2 characters (just above Temenos). Kit revolves around being fastest to act - speed crucial for her effectiveness.

# Strategic analysis from YouTube tutorial
usage_strategy: |
  Throné is good now as a breaker but not great. Can potentially deal up to 12 hits using 6-hit attack + latent ability double cast. Miss Physical Attack status is nice for enemies charging ultimate attacks, but spending 1 turn and 4 BP for one-time infliction is questionable. Most will use her for dagger breaking capabilities.

best_use_cases:
  - "Dagger weakness breaking with high hit counts"
  - "Teams needing Miss Physical Attack status infliction"
  - "Fast-paced teams where she can act first"
  - "Players needing dedicated dagger breaker"

weaknesses:
  - "Low HP and physical attack - squishy and won't deal massive damage"
  - "Will be power crept by future thieves (two coming that will leave current thieves in dust)"
  - "Limited to dagger/dark damage types"
  - "Requires high speed investment to be effective"

  notes: "Niche and nice to have but question if worth using over accessories that give more damage. Miss Physical Attack on break is useful but situational"
