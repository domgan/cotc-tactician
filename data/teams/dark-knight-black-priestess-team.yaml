why_it_works: |
  Black Priestess partnership dramatically simplifies DK setup. Black Priestess
  gives DK access to all elemental exploits in the game, and 99% of enemies have
  both elemental and physical weaknesses. This means you don't need to get DK's
  passive up to 7 cursed puppets - only need 5 members down after turn 3.
  Setup is much faster: Turn 1 kill back row, Turn 2 ultimate + kill auto-revive,
  Turn 3 EX skill + Black Priestess ultimate, Turn 4 main damage.

key_synergies:
  - "Dark Knight + Black Priestess: All elemental exploits, only 5 cursed puppets needed"
  - "Dark Knight + Nona: 30% potency up for massive damage"
  - "Black Priestess: Covers all elemental weaknesses (99% of enemies)"
  - "Faster setup: 4 turns vs 7 turns for full puppet setup"

risks_and_recovery:
  - "Risk: Black Priestess availability (premium character)"
  - "Recovery: Can fall back to full 7 puppet setup"
  - "Risk: Ultimate positioning (20% ultimate moves DK to back row)"
  - "Recovery: Ensure ultimate gauge management"
  - "Risk: Still requires 4-5 turn setup"
  - "Recovery: Same recovery options as standard setup"
