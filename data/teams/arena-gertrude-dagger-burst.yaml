turn_plan:
  - turn_range: "1"
    phase: setup
    actions:
      - "Stack 30% P.ATK debuff (FREE TURN - no attack!)"
      - "Sarisa + Auguste/Viola debuff"
    notes: "Gertrude doesn't attack turn 1!"

  - turn_range: "2-6"
    phase: break_push
    actions:
      - "Use SINGLE-HIT attacks only (multi-hit useless!)"
      - "Maintain debuffs"
      - "Fiore EX covers dangerous attacks"
    notes: "Multi-hit shield lock: max 2 shields per action"

  - turn_range: "HP <33%"
    phase: burst
    actions:
      - "TRIPLE ACTIONS + Heal Slash spam"
      - "Use INSTANT healing, not just auto-regen"
      - "Burst finish"
    notes: "Very dangerous phase - finish quickly!"

why_it_works: |
  From Game8: Dagger is the highest damage option.
  Thieves have strong single-hit skills + debuff synergy.
  
  CRITICAL: Use SINGLE-HIT attacks only!
  Multi-hit attacks are useless due to shield lock.
  
  Fiore EX is the only tank that works (provoke immune).
  
  SHIELD SKIP TRICK: Push from >75% to <50% in one break
  to skip the shield increase (stays at 9 instead of 12).

key_synergies:
  - "Turn 1 free debuff setup"
  - "Thieves have single-hit + debuffs"
  - "Fiore EX Cover bypasses provoke immunity"

risks_and_recovery:
  - "Multi-hit useless: Use single-hit only!"
  - "Triple actions at 33%: Need instant healing"
  - "Provoke immune: Only Fiore EX works as tank"
