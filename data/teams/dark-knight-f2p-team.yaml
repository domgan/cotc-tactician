why_it_works: |
  This team follows the exact setup shown in the video. Nona and EX Primrose
  provide ultimate gauge acceleration, allowing DK to reach his 4-5 turn setup
  faster. Lucetta extends DK's buffs by one turn. The team focuses on getting
  all 7 cursed puppets for DK's passive to exploit all physical weaknesses.

key_synergies:
  - "Dark Knight + Nona: 30% potency up dramatically increases damage"
  - "Dark Knight + EX Primrose: Faster ultimate gauge generation"
  - "Lucetta: Extends DK's buffs by one turn"
  - "7 Cursed Puppet passive: Exploits all physical weaknesses"

risks_and_recovery:
  - "Risk: Long setup time (4-5 turns) leaves team vulnerable"
  - "Recovery: Auto-revives from Ophilia on Lucetta"
  - "Risk: BP management issues"
  - "Recovery: Mafa support, keeper BP recovery"
  - "Risk: Cursed Puppet not fully charged"
  - "Recovery: Black Priestess partnership reduces requirement to 5"
