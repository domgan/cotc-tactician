turn_plan:
  - turn_range: "1-3"
    phase: "setup"
    actions:
      - "Scarecrow: Multi-target attacks on adds"
      - "Trish: Hermit's Might on researcher"
      - "Sigrid: Trifold Slash on adds"
      - "Viola: Attack debuff on Varkyn"

  - turn_range: "4-6"
    phase: "break_push"
    actions:
      - "Continue focusing researcher"
      - "Get Varkyn down to 50% HP"
      - "Take out dancer when researcher dies"
      - "Use Viola anti-attack when needed"
    notes: "Researcher death triggers Spirit Stone summon"

  - turn_range: "7-10"
    phase: "sustain"
    actions:
      - "DO NOT USE BUFFS (Spirit Stone dispels them)"
      - "Only use DEBUFFS on enemies"
      - "Track Spirit Stone weakness cycle: Staff → Sword → Ice"
      - "Break Varkyn and damage during break windows"
    notes: "Spirit Stone phase - buffs are useless"

  - turn_range: "11-15"
    phase: "burst"
    actions:
      - "Break Varkyn just before 35% HP"
      - "Burst damage during break window"
      - "Spread attackers between front/back for SP drain backup"
      - "Use emergency heals as needed"
    notes: "Musou Munen phase at 35% HP - dangerous attacks"

# ===========================================================================
# BUFF/DEBUFF PLAN
# ===========================================================================
buff_stacking:
  - buff_type: "Enemy Attack Down"
    sources: ["Viola"]
    target_cap: "30%+"
    timing: "Turn 1 onwards (only debuffs work!)"

  - buff_type: "Party Attack Up"
    sources: ["Pia (Take Command)"]
    target_cap: "15%"
    timing: "When needed (will be dispelled by Spirit Stone)"

# ===========================================================================
# EXPLANATION
# ===========================================================================
why_it_works: |
  This team focuses on eliminating adds first to trigger Spirit Stone, then adapts to buff-dispel mechanics.
  Trish provides highest damage output with Hermit's Might.
  Scarecrow effectively hits both adds for shield shaving.
  Viola's attack debuffs are crucial since buffs get dispelled.
  Team avoids using buffs after Spirit Stone appears.

key_synergies:
  - "Trish highest damage dealer with Hermit's Might + Guillotine"
  - "Scarecrow multi-target coverage for both adds"
  - "Viola attack debuffs work even when buffs are dispelled"
  - "Pia's Take Command provides attack buff before dispels start"

risks_and_recovery:
  - "Spirit Stone dispels ALL buffs every turn"
  - "Spirit Stone has infinite shields - cannot be broken"
  - "At Varkyn HP ≤50%: Spirit Stone gains double actions + weakness counter"
  - "Musou Munen at 35% HP causes extremely dangerous attacks"
  - "Must track Spirit Stone weakness cycle to avoid counter attacks"
