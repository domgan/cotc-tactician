why_it_works: |
  This is a minimal investment team that allows players to use Dark Knight with
  just essential support. Ophilia provides crucial auto-revive to keep the
  Cursed Puppet buildup going, Lucetta extends what few buffs are available,
  and Herminia adds light damage coverage. This setup focuses on getting DK
  to his damage phase with minimal character investment.

key_synergies:
  - "Dark Knight + Ophilia: Auto-revive keeps Cursed Puppet chain going"
  - "Dark Knight + Lucetta: Extended buff duration for longer damage windows"
  - "Dark Knight + Herminia: Additional light weakness coverage"

risks_and_recovery:
  - "Risk: Very limited support makes setup fragile"
  - "Recovery: Ophilia auto-revive provides safety net"
  - "Risk: Lower damage output without full support"
  - "Recovery: May need multiple break cycles"
  - "Risk: Cursed Puppet buildup slower"
  - "Recovery: Accept longer fight times, focus on survival"
