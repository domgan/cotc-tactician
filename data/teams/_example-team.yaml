speed_tuning_notes: |
  [PLACEHOLDER]
  - Debuffer is naturally fast, no tuning needed
  - Buffer needs speed accessory to beat tank
  - DPS should be slowest to receive all buffs before acting

why_it_works: |
  [PLACEHOLDER EXPLANATION]
  
  This team exploits the boss's fire weakness while handling the key mechanics:
  
  1. Tank absorbs the ultimate attack with mitigation skill
  2. Healer provides consistent party healing and attack buff
  3. Debuffer reduces boss defense and fire resistance
  4. Fire DPS deals massive damage during break windows
  
  The speed order ensures buffs are applied before DPS acts.
  Buff durations are managed to persist through break windows.

key_synergies:
  - "[PLACEHOLDER] Buffer's attack up stacks with DPS's self-buff"
  - "[PLACEHOLDER] Debuffer's fire res down multiplies with defense down"
  - "[PLACEHOLDER] Tank's provoke protects the squishy DPS"

risks_and_recovery:
  - "[PLACEHOLDER] If tank dies to ultimate, no provoke - heal up and revive ASAP"
  - "[PLACEHOLDER] If DPS dies, switch to secondary DPS from back line"
  - "[PLACEHOLDER] If buffs drop before break, reset buff rotation"
