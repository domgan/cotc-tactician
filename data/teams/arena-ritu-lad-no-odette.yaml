      - "Lynette: Incinerating Staff (fire hits Ri'tu weakness)"
      - "Continue wind attacks for shield shaving"
      - "Use emergency heals as needed"
    notes: "Kill swordsman first to remove Guardian Stance protection"

  - turn_range: "8-12"
    phase: "break_window"
    actions:
      - "Target Carefree Dancer second"
      - "Use light attacks on Ri'tu + dancer"
      - "Maintain attack debuffs"
      - "Break and damage during windows"
    notes: "Dancer provides dangerous P.ATK/CRIT buffs"

  - turn_range: "13-18"
    phase: "burst"
    actions:
      - "Focus on Ri'tu last"
      - "Watch for pursuit attacks at 50% HP"

# ===========================================================================
# BUFF/DEBUFF PLAN
# ===========================================================================
buff_stacking:
  - buff_type: "Physical Defense"
    sources: ["Mina (Defense Up)", "Mole Dance"]
    target_cap: "30%+"
    timing: "Turn 1 onwards"

  - buff_type: "Enemy Attack Down"
    sources: ["Viola"]
    target_cap: "30%+"
    timing: "Turn 1 onwards"

  - buff_type: "Fire Damage"
    sources: ["Lynette"]
    target_cap: "Varies"
    timing: "When targeting Ri'tu"

# ===========================================================================
# EXPLANATION
# ===========================================================================
why_it_works: |
  This team uses wind attacks (consistent weakness for all 3 enemies) plus fire/light for specific targets.
  Lynette's Incinerating Staff is perfect for Ri'tu's fire weakness.
  Mina provides defense up and light attacks in one package.
  Team follows proper kill order: Swordsman first, then Dancer, then Ri'tu.

key_synergies:
  - "Wind attacks hit all 3 enemies consistently"
  - "Lynette fire damage exploits Ri'tu's fire weakness"
  - "Mina provides both defense up and light coverage"
  - "Proper kill order removes dangerous mechanics"

risks_and_recovery:
  - "Steadfast Swordsman protects Ri'tu with Guardian Stance"
  - "Carefree Dancer provides P.ATK/CRIT buffs to enemies"
  - "Ri'tu gains pursuit attacks at 50% HP (extra attacks)"
  - "Ri'tu uses Severing spam at 25% HP (3000+ damage single hits)"
  - "Must maintain 1500+ defense to survive attacks"
